1
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,112
Thank you, Ryner, for all you
and the Olkari have done to assist us.

2
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,656
Once we defeat Zarkon,

3
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,327
j'espère que nous unirons
encore nos forces pour reconstruire

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,498
it is my hope that we can continue
to unite our forces

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,918
and rebuild the once great coalition
that my father, King Alfor, began.

6
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,296
�

7
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,764
[all cheering]

00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,521
>

9
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,106
Princess, it's time.

10
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,924
Everyone lock into position.
We're taking this thing up.

11
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,094
Princess, we are go for launch.

12
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:20,265
Charging main turbine.

13
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,477
Commander Thace, you have sent
encrypted messages to outside forces.

14
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,735
Of this, we are keenly aware.

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,113
Encryptions can be broken, just like you.

16
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,615
[screaming]

17
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,827
It was you who destroyed the sentries
and powered down the solar barrier.

18
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,413
You allowed Voltron to escape.

19
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,457
You betrayed Zarkon!

20
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,086
Who else is part of this conspiracy?

21
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,339
[screaming]

22
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,092
[screaming continues]

23
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,136
All right, guys, listen up.

24
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,264
I'll use the Black Lion to lure
Zarkon's fleet to our current location

25
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,016
and make sure he's within
the teludav's area of effect.

26
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,435
Keeping the teludav hidden
behind the space-fold

27
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,771
until the last possible second
is essential.

28
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,565
We can count on you, right, Slav?

29
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,150
Absolutely. I'll be fine.

30
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,485
I'm not sure about
the gravity generator, though.

31
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,529
What? What was that last thing?

32
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,158
Hiding a ship is one thing,

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,494
but I've never had to build
a gravity generator

34
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,164
for something this large before.

35
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,666
I know it'll work,
but I'm not really sure for how long.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,504
Well, that's a risk we'll have to take.

37
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,882
Once Zarkon's ship is in position,

38
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,848
Kolivan and Antok
will coordinate with Thace.

39
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,768
Together, they'll take down Zarkon's
security system and upload the virus.

40
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,896
And then, he'll be a sitting du-flax.

41
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,566
What? A du-flax is an Altean creature
with a beak and webbed feet.

42
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,527
We'll wormhole Zarkon
500 million light years away,

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,571
and he'll be in the Yggiz Galaxy
before he knows what's hit him!

44
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,739
-What about Thace?
-He should be getting into position now.

45
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,299
We received his last communication
three quintants ago.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,136
We should hear from him soon.

47
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,389
Let's do it.

48
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,558
[groaning]

49
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,145
Why do you disturb me?

50
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:36,442
My apologies, sire.

51
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,611
-I fear your singular focus has--
-Has what?

52
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,824
I've overstepped my bounds.

53
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,536
We've apprehended a spy within our ranks.
He plans something with an outside force.

54
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,039
I suspect an attack is imminent.

55
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,019
Let your druids find out what he knows.
You will stay here.

56
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,729
The only thing that matters to me
is getting the Black Lion.

57
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,189
I need the power you possess
to search the galaxy.

58
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,234
[gasps]

59
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,781
[groaning]

60
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,203
[panting]

61
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,830
I have found the lion.

62
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,498
Get the fleet into hyper drive!
I know where the Black Lion is.

63
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,293
Zarkon took the bait.
He's got my location.

64
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,128
Is everybody in position?

65
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,547
We've not yet heard from Thace.

66
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,840
He was supposed to contact us
two vargas ago.

67
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,967
He could've been captured.

68
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,845
Or killed. We need to abort
the mission immediately.

69
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,097
Abort?

70
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,560
No! We cannot back away now.

71
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,937
The Blade of Marmora
does not take chances.

72
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,357
It's how we've survived for so long.

73
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,859
It's held you back. Your caution
is the reason Zarkon is still in power.

74
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,402
We would rather wait
than jeopardize everything.

75
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,572
Besides, it's too late
to get someone else on the inside.

76
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,825
-I'll do it.
-What?

77
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,743
I'll sneak onto Zarkon's ship.

78
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm Galra, so I'll be able to interact
with their technology.

79
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,414
Pidge, you can rig up one of those pods
with a cloaking device, right?

80
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,166
Well, yeah.

81
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,669
Going onto Zarkon's ship
is a suicide mission.

82
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,258
I would never command
someone so inexperienced

83
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,343
to go on a mission so dangerous.

84
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,013
No one's commanding me. I'm doing it.

85
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,267
Pidge, get that pod ready.

86
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
Keith...

87
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,146
let me know when you're on your way.
I'll give you cover.

88
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,777
Okay, the cloaking device is ready to go.

89
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,076
[Allura] Pidge...

90
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,829
may I have a moment with Keith, please?

91
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:58,292
Sure thing. Have all the moments you like.

92
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,586
Is there something I can help you with?

93
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,880
I... I just wanted to say...

94
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,761
the Galra, they've done terrible things.

95
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,974
Destroyed entire civilizations.

96
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,725
They took my family.

97
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,602
But, in time, I've grown to consider
you and the paladins my family.

98
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
So, when I learned you were Galra, I...

99
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,648
I didn't know what to think.

100
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:25,319
I wanted to hate you.

101
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,660
Allura...

102
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,830
-It's--
-But it's not you.

103
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,915
It's me. My anger has
blinded me for too long.

104
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,168
I'm so sorry I misjudged you.

105
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,211
You've proven,
it's not what's in your blood.

106
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,590
It's who you are that counts.

107
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,094
Please come back to us.

108
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,958
I will.

109
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,710
[beeping]

110
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,967
They're here.

111
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,474
Send the fighters! Surround that lion!

112
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,560
Draw him in!

113
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,270
I want every ship in the fleet
after that lion. Get me closer!

114
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,524
I've got Zarkon on the hook.
Bringing him your way.

115
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,360
Keith, you ready?
We've only got one shot at this!

116
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,486
Engaging cloaking device.

117
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,344
Moving toward the fleet now.

118
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,099
Roger that. I don't see you,
but I'm locked on your signal.

119
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,730
I'll clear a path.

120
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,068
Thanks, Shiro. I'm coming in hot!

121
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,320
[grunting]

122
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,657
I'm in.

123
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
The plan is working. Keith is on board
and Zarkon's fleet is on the way.

124
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,688
The Castle of Lion defenses are up
and ready to go.

125
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,648
Starting gravity generator now.

126
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,484
[Slav]
Commencing cloak.

127
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,070
[screaming]

128
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,160
[groaning]

129
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,849
We are tracking the Black Lion.

130
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,228
We know this is part of a bigger plan.

131
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,606
Where is he going?

132
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,610
[grunts]

133
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,904
[Kolivan] Okay, you've made it
to the lower communication deck.

134
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,240
Head left down that corridor.

135
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,076
[Antok]
Based on the schematics from Thace,

136
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,877
there should be a large door up ahead.

137
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,798
This is the central hub
for the Galra fleet.

138
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,467
I see it.

139
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,885
I'm two minutes out. Is everybody ready?

140
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:22,723
[Kolivan]
No, Keith hasn't made it to the hub yet.

141
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:27,103
-We need more time.
-[grunting]

142
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,940
How much more?

143
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,361
I hope not much because my gravity
generator is not going to run forever!

144
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,280
I don't know how much longer I can hold
Zarkon's fleet in this position by myself!

145
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,574
[Pidge]
You won't have to!

146
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,700
Good timing.

147
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,536
Okay, we've got Zarkon's ship
right where it needs to be.

148
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,340
We gotta keep it here
until that virus is uploaded.

149
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,634
Let's do it!

150
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,221
-All right!
-We got this!

151
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,649
Flank the Black Lion! Surround him!

152
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,278
Sire, I fear this could be a trap!

153
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,948
Get me more power.
I must connect to the Black Lion.

154
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,660
Kolivan, I'm in. Now what?

155
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,412
Now you need to reset the system,
using the codes that Thace obtained.

156
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,169
It'll be down for a dobosh.
That's when we'll upload the virus.

157
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,432
-[rapid beeping]
-It doesn't seem to be working.

158
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,440
-Try it again.
-[door beeps]

159
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,067
Keith, are you there?

160
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,111
And now we know you were attempting
to shut down the system.

161
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,198
You're too late.

162
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,413
No, Thace. You're too late.

163
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,523
We already changed the code.

164
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,572
[rapid beeping]

165
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,201
[screams]

166
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,744
[screams]

167
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,204
Thace, I'm Keith, a Paladin of Voltron.

168
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,091
And a fellow Blade, I see.

169
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,391
I guess we haven't failed.

170
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,228
Not yet.

171
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,201
[grunting]

172
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,204
Yeah! That was close.

173
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,039
-Somebody! Anybody! A little help here!
-Lure them to me!

174
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,258
[beeping]

175
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,262
Zarkon's ship is leaving
the teludav's area of effect.

176
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,055
You must guide it back in.

177
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,934
This is getting hairy.
How you doing, Keith?

178
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,314
The Galra switched the codes.
We're trying a work-around.

179
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,275
[Lance]
"We"? Who's "we"?

180
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,028
-Thace. I found him. I'll explain later.
-[Shiro] Copy that.

181
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,614
What exactly are you doing?

182
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,537
I'm using the main power
to overload the system.

183
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,623
You're turning the room into a bomb?

184
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,753
It's the only way.

185
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,380
Thace has barricaded himself
in the central hub.

186
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,176
We believe he's trying
to shut down the system.

187
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,430
[Haggar] He's working
with the paladins. It was a trap.

188
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,435
[Zarkon panting]

189
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,897
Get the spy. I will end this firefight.

190
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,067
[whimpering]

191
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,906
Uh, everyone, the gravity generator
won't maintain power much longer.

192
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,014
If it goes down, we're just going
to be uncloaked in open space.

193
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,518
[Shiro] Do all you can.
We just need to hold out a little longer.

194
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,061
[grunting]

195
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,398
That solves one problem,
but now we're trapped in here.

196
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,067
No, we're not. There's an exit
through the main power conduit.

197
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,278
It leads to the second deck.

198
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,865
Go, now.

199
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,285
What? No, I'm not gonna leave you.

200
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,870
You must. I will shut down the system.

201
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,335
Paladin, this is where my journey ends,

202
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,131
but, as a member of Voltron,
you have a bigger mission.

203
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,238
You must understand that.

204
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,493
It was an honor to meet you.

205
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,204
Go! Now!

206
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,250
[powering down]

207
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,304
-[alarm blaring]
-Oh, I hate it when I'm right.

208
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,564
The gravity generator just lost power!

209
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,830
Now there's no reality
where we all get out alive!

210
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,125
Princess, the teludav
is completely exposed!

211
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,671
Come on, Keith.

212
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,882
-What do we do?
-We can't do anything.

213
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,592
If Keith doesn't get Zarkon's ship
shut down, we're done for. It's over.

214
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,999
Charge the ion cannon! Take it down!

215
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,251
[Allura] We cannot wait any longer.

216
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,547
I'm powering the teludav now!

217
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,855
[gasps]

218
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,773
[screams]

219
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,823
[grunting]

220
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,344
[grunting, panting]

221
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,768
[growls]

222
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,024
The system is down. Uploading virus now.

223
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,866
No!

224
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,459
Thace did it.

225
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,003
[purring]

226
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,138
[grunting]

227
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,849
[sighs]

228
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,777


229
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,281
Everyone, hang on! Here we go!

230
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,344
[Coran]
Hurry, Paladins!

231
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,555
We must make it in
before the wormhole closes!

232
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,432
-Coran, how's Allura?
-She's weak, but okay.

233
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,976
You take care of her.
We got it from here.

234
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,186
We did it! I can't believe we did it!

235
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,844
See, I told you we could do it.

236
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,845
It's not over yet.
