1
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,526
[Allura]
We'll be arriving at the Balmera soon.

2
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,946
Libérer les Balmerans
de l'emprise de Zarkon ne sera pas facile.

3
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,077
Liberating these Balmerans
from Zarkon's grasp will not be easy.

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,328
So, what's the plan? We go in there
and just-- pow, pow, pow!

5
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,746
And free the prisoners?

6
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,955
What was that noise?

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,584
Laser guns.

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,547
No, Lance, I think you mean--
[imitates lasers firing]

9
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,384
-Pow!
-That sounds like fireworks.

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,679
Technically, they're more like--
ba-choo, ba-choo, ba-choo!

11
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,349
�

12
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,683
Okay, enough with the bad sound effects.

13
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,101
Besides, it's more like--
blam, blam, blam!

14
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,728
-What?
-You're crazy.

15
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,732
-No way.
-Wrong.

16
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,235
Concentrez-vous, les paladins.

17
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:54,239
Paladins, focus.

18
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,616
Besides, we can't just shoot at the Galra.
This Balmera, it's, like, alive.

19
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,994
And from what we've seen,
it doesn't look very good.

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,372
Yes, it's an atrocity what the Galra
have been doing to this grand beast.

21
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,375
Stealing its crystals,
its very life force,

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,627
without ever performing the energy
rejuvenation ceremonies to heal it.

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,130
After seeing Shay's people enslaved,

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,591
it made me realize
how bad Zarkon really is.

25
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,884
And we're the only ones
who can stop him.

26
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,346
Okay, so we can't go into the tunnels
guns blazing.

27
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,099
Plan B. We figure out how to draw
the Galra up to the surface

28
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,561
and battle them out there.

29
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,480
I know. If we attack all of this
big mining stuff on the surface,

30
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,482
the Galra troops
will have to come out to defend it.

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,235
Then we beat them up, head down
to the tunnels, Voltron saves the day.

32
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,070
How will we know
how many are left in the tunnels?

33
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,116
We can track the Galra
and the Balmerans

34
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,578
using Biothermal Life Indicator
Point Technology.

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,789
Oh, BLIP tech!

36
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,791
-It's an acronym.
-One of you will need

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,294
to fly around the Balmera and drop sensors
into the shafts on each side.

38
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,212
Así veremos dónde están.
Sus trajes ya tienen sensores.

39
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,548
Then we'll be able to see
where the Galra and the Balmerans are.

40
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,174
There are already sensors
built into your suits.

41
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,303
I can do it.
I just modified the Green Lion

42
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,222
with the invisible maze's
cloaking ability.

43
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,892
I should be able to fly around unnoticed.

44
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,894
That's their main power generator.

45
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,521
If you take that down,
it will severely weaken their defenses.

46
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,024
We'll stay in cloud cover
and give tactical support.

47
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,277
With the Castle's defenses
weakened from Sendak's crystal,

48
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,254
we won't be of much help to you.

49
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,592
I'll take out the power generator.
Keith, Lance, Hunk,

50
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,304
you take out these big mining rigs
around the area.

51
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,573
Yeah! Okay, let's do this!
Let's go kick some alien butt!

52
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,492
You think the Balmerans will have a parade
for us after we've freed everybody?

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,621
It's not about the glory, Lance.
It's about freeing prisoners from Zarkon.

54
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,458
No, I know. I know. But still.
When they-- [grunts]

55
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,813
This is it. Get your heads
in the game. Remember,

56
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,774
the Balmera is a living creature.

57
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,986
Make sure you pinpoint only the Galra
installations and not its surface.

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,967
[Pidge]
Initiating cloak.

59
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,148
How do I take this thing down?

60
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,899
What's that?

61
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,818
Jaw blade? Okay! Let's do this!

62
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,740
[Pidge]
All sensors delivered.

63
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,869
Whoa! Did you guys just see that?
I got fire power!

64
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,125
Hey! I want that!

65
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,389
[Keith]
Oh, no!

66
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,933
[Hunk] Hey, we can't let this thing
hurt the Balmera.

67
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,316
[grunting]

68
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,736
[Lance]
I think my lion knows what to do!

69
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,239
Aw, snap!
These rays are super cool, just like me!

70
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,742
[Shiro]
Great job, team!

71
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,036
Where are all the troops?
They're not coming to the surface.

72
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,913
Yeah, I remember seeing
a lot of Galra guys down in the mines.

73
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,957
We've located a hangar full
of Galra fighters just below the surface.

74
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,210
Alguien debe acabar con ellos
antes de su despegue.

75
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,503
Someone has to take those out
before they can launch.

76
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,296
Nos hacen bajar, no hay opción.
Keith, Lance, ataquen.

77
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,806
They're luring us down,
but we have no choice.

78
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,476
Keith, Lance, you guys hit the hangar.

79
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,188
Hunk, head to the prison to rescue
Shay and the other Balmerans.

80
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,983
Pidge and I will track down
the Galra soldiers.

81
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,363
-[Keith] Yes, sir.
-[Lance] Ten-four.

82
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:50,576
-[Pidge] On it.
-[Hunk] Let's do this!

83
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,735
Commander Prorok, we have word
from the troops on Balmera X-95 Vox.

84
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,865
The informants were right.
Voltron is there.

85
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,452
Excellent. Everything is going
according to plan.

86
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,036
How do you wish to proceed?
Should we inform Emperor Zarkon?

87
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,998
Contact Subcommander Ylvik.
His fleet is awaiting my command.

88
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,458
Tell him it's time to attack.
I will update the Emperor.

89
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,420
[Keith] The entire hangar's
only being guarded by a few sentries.

90
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,547
-Let's go!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Cool your jets, Keith!

91
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,800
Don't you remember that stuff about this
Balmera thing being a sensitive animal?

92
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,523
Oh, right.

93
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,484
Yeah, so we can't just blow things up
like a psycho.

94
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,112
You got a better idea?

95
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,324
I do. We sneak into the control room
to shut down the bay doors.

96
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,367
-That'll trap the ships in.
-That...

97
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,452
actually is a better idea.

98
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,704
Allura, Coran, what's my location?
All these tunnels look the same.

99
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,748
I can't remember where the prison is.

100
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,505
You're on the right path.
Turn right at the next tunnel.

101
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,716
Once you get there,
you'll have to disable the energy doors.

102
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:39,060
Be careful.
It looks like it's heavily guarded.

103
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,770
[electronic beeping]

104
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,317
[Lance whispering]
No, no. It's over here.

105
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,319
[Keith whispering]
I know what I'm doing.

106
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,529
[grunts]
Keep an eye out for those guards.

107
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,329
I'll see if I can find a way
to shut the hangar doors.

108
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,460
[Lance]
Uh... Hmm. Nope. Maybe. Uh...

109
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,129
5

110
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,882
Uh... Mm...

111
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,985
[groans]
I don't know what I'm doing here.

112
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,114
It's all Galra gibberish.

113
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,074
[Keith] Let me see.

114
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,077
[computer beeps]

115
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,747
[doors whirring]

116
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,425
Whoa! How'd you do that?

117
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,095
I just put my hand on the handprint.

118
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,225
[grunts]

119
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,313
[grunts]

120
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,774
Yeah!

121
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,361
That was way too easy.

122
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,904
I definitely don't have
a good feeling about this.

123
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,407
[panting]

124
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,118
[panting]

125
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,498
Hunk, you have returned.

126
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,751
I promised I'd be back.
We're here to help. Where's Shay?

127
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,254
Our life may not have been perfect,
but our family was whole.

128
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,340
Your arrival has left us
imprisoned and torn apart.

129
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,134
As soon as your attack started,

130
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,845
they took her away
to the core of the Balmera.

131
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,307
For all we know,
she could be gone for good.

132
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,225
Paladins, are you there? The Galra troops
are moving down the tunnels.

133
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,478
It looks like they're going down
toward the center.

134
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,570
They must be headed to the core.
That's where they're holding Shay.

135
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,077
[Shiro]
They're drawing us into an ambush,

136
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,828
but we don't have a choice
if we want to save Shay.

137
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,749
We have to follow.
Lance, Keith, get to the core.

138
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,292
I think we're going to need everyone
together to get through this firefight.

139
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,543
Copy that. We're on our way.

140
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,174
[grunts]

141
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,260
[gasps]

142
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,097
[Allura] You're in an area where the
tunnels are too narrow for your speeder.

143
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,849
Indo a pé.

144
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,018
Yeah. Proceeding on foot.

145
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,399
[whispering]
There's someone here.

146
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,820
[Allura]
Looking into it.

147
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,698
[footsteps approaching]

148
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,784
Pidge, no! Those are Balmerans!

149
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,081
Phew!

150
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,708
[groans]

151
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,714
[Balmerans whimpering, panting]

152
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,466
-[groans]
-[both gasp]

153
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,849
[grunts]

154
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,142
Don't worry.

155
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,729
[Pidge] Hey, team, be careful.
The Balmera is very unstable.

156
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,314
[both grunt]

157
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,828
Their shooting is destroying the Balmera.
We gotta do something.

158
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,663
[Balmera moaning]

159
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,290
[grunts] Well, we can't shoot back.
It'll just make it worse.

160
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,003
[panting]

161
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,472
Hmm...

162
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,809
[growls]

163
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,895
[grunting incoherently]

164
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,191
Huh?

165
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:02,281
[grunts, sings tauntingly]

166
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:03,991
[yelps]

167
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,368
[grunting]

168
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,954
[grunts]

169
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,956
[yelling]

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,710
Shay! You're alive!

171
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,670
[muffled moaning]

172
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,591
[muffled screaming]

173
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,969
Where are the Galra? If this is an ambush,
they should be here waiting for us.

174
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,014
[gasps]

175
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,767
[both gasp]

176
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,520
/

177
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,440
Not an ambush. More like a trap.

178
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,692
Whatever it is, keep your guard up.

179
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,986
The Galra, they gained knowledge
that you would return to the Balmera.

180
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,112
-How?
-I know not.

181
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,950
But they set this trap just for you.
I was the bait.

182
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,794
Who could have possibly known
that we were heading here to save Shay?

183
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,672
Rolo! Those liars must have told Zarkon.

184
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,092
We have to figure out
how to get out of here.

185
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,513
Wait! We have a giant Castle ship
hovering in the sky.

186
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,434
-Allura, can you please come get us?
-How do you expect her to do that, genius?

187
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,187
I don't know, maybe they got
teleporters or something.

188
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,065
We're quite occupied at the moment.

189
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,150
[grunts]

190
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,403
We're completely surrounded by
Galra ships and we're taking heavy fire!

191
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,282
[alarm blaring]

192
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,908
Princess, our particle barrier
won't last much longer!

193
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,536
Paladins, you need to get out of there
as soon as you can!

194
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,000
This is it! We're going to die in here.
I can say bye-bye to that parade.

195
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,803
Get it together, guys.
Allura, we'll get there as soon as we can.

196
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,228
Perhaps my people can help us get out.

197
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,817
This is how we communicate.

198
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,736
The Balmera senses our vibrations

199
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:08,532
and sends a message
to those in the tunnels.

200
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,326
Are you sure someone
will be able to hear your... hand

201
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,703
from all the way down here?

202
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,291
The Balmera will deliver the message.

203
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,169
[Balmera moaning softly]

204
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,046
[Balmera continues moaning]

205
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,007
[gasps]

206
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,762
It's a message from Shay.

207
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,805
She's alive!

208
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,475
The Paladins of Voltron went to the core
of the Balmera to save Shay...

209
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,852
y están atrapados.

210
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,105
and now they are all trapped.

211
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,902
Then we are all doomed.

212
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,029
This is all my fault.
I conspired against them,

213
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:51,325
and, because of my actions,
Shay was imprisoned.

214
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,035
The big yellow one was right.

215
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,086
If we ever hope to be free,
we must take action.

216
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,172
But how can we rise up
against our Galra overlords?

217
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,132
What choice do we have?

218
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:12,596
They have stolen all of the crystals
from our Balmera.

219
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,393
Our lives are worthless to them now.

220
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:22,231
But Balmerans have never fought.

221
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,610
You taught me that without family,
we have nothing.

222
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,654
The Galra have taken Shay.

223
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,741
How can we do nothing while the paladins
sacrifice everything to save us?

224
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,328
We must do our part!

225
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,964
[Prorok] Lord Zarkon,
I have news to report.

226
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,472
News that will likely please you,
my Emperor.

227
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,851
Proceed.

228
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,827
I have the Voltron Paladins trapped on
a Balmera in the Javeeno star system.

229
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,748
I've ordered a fleet to capture the lions
and destroy the Altean Castle.

230
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,207
You fool! You dare make plans
without informing me?

231
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,502
Forgive me, Emperor,
but I saw an opportunity and I took it

232
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,255
for the glory of the Galra Empire.

233
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,051
I suspect that you are seeking
your own glory, Prorok.

234
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,387
But you do not realize Voltron's power.

235
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,766
They're heading down into the tunnels!
[gasps] They're going to steal the lions!

236
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,485
Paladins, the lions are in danger!
You must get back to them immediately!

237
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,615


238
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,534
-[alarm blaring]
-Princess, something's locked onto us.

239
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,412
[Allura] Paladins, do you copy?
There's a battle cruiser locked onto us.

240
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,376
If it fires with its ion cannon,
I don't know if we can survive.

241
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,004
[Lance]
We're trying, Allura.

242
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,385
Shay's pressing her hand against a wall,
which apparently sends vibrations

243
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,054
to the other rock people,
who vibrate back or something?

244
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,098
Hand talking? I guess the answer
to your question is, "Yes, we copy."

245
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,726
Shay, are you sure the Balmera
is sending your message?

246
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,437
[Balmera moaning]

247
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,440
[all gasp]

248
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,819
Rax!

249
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,112
We must make haste.
We know a shortcut through the tunnels.

250
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,150
Allura, stand by. We're on our way up.

251
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,610
[Allura] Paladins, hurry!
They're taking off with the lions!

252
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,446
[grunting, yelling]

253
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,827
[growling]

254
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,954
[roars]

255
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,512
[roars]

256
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,850
Guys, did everyone make it
to the lions in time?

257
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,811
[Lance]
Come on, Shiro.

258
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,521
Who you think you're dealing with,
a bunch of amateurs? [yelps]

259
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,607
-Do you really want me to answer that?
-[Lance] No.

260
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,057
[Shiro]
Let's go!

261
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,092
[Pidge]
Hunk, watch out!

262
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,729
[Keith]
Got you covered!

263
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,943
Phew!
Thanks, guys!

264
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,699
[Coran]
It's charging its ion cannon!

265
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,685
Divert all shields to the bow.

266
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,479
-[grunting]
-[alarm blaring]

267
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,152
Paladins, I need you immediately!
Five more ticks and we're finished!

268
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,405
Okay, team, let's form Voltron!

269
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,910
Yeah!

270
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:14,833
[roars]

271
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,422
[roars]

272
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,341
[all yelling]

273
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,677
Right now is our chance, Princess!

274
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,138
Full power on the blasters!
Locked onto target. Fire!

275
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,434
[both gasp]

276
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,944
-[Hunk, Keith] Yeah!
-[Pidge] Nice shot, Princess!

277
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,614
[Lance]
Yeah! The parade's back on!

278
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,615
[soldier] The Galra fleet and all sentries
on the Balmera have been defeated.
