1
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,149
[Shiro]
Okay, look.

2
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,986
I now know for certain that Zarkon
is tracking us through the Black Lion.

3
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,988
We have to find some way to stop him.

4
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,448
How are we gonna do that?

5
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,911
We've never had this situation before.
Two paladins battling for the same lion.

6
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:22,332
Well, unless we want Zarkon taking control
of Voltron every time we get close...

7
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,876
I'll have to forge a new bond
with my lion.

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,669
One that's stronger than his.

9
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,296
Well, while you're working on that...

10
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,715
the rest of us need to find
some new teludav lenses...

11
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,426
otherwise we won't be able
to travel via wormhole.

12
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,846
-Is that something we have to mail order?
-Does anyone even make those anymore?

13
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,139
[Allura]
I don't know.

14
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,976
Only a few Alteans could use
the teludav 10,000 ago.

15
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,103
They may not exist anymore.

16
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,441
I think I may know where we can get some.

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,531
Coran!

18
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,867
You're not suggesting going
to one of those filthy swap moons!

19
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,994
The last time you went,
those space pirates

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,663
took you for everything you had.

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,206
Space pirates?

22
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,166
The Unilu were traders and pirates...

23
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,086
that roamed the galaxies
and dealt in black market goods.

24
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,048
Umvy spice, by-tor water,
little bottles of infinity vapor.

25
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,093
Of course, you had to bargain.
No one could bargain like the Unilu.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,346
Last time, I ended up giving away
three quarters of my shipment of lango...

27
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,640
in exchange for a used pogo oscillator.

28
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,683
[chuckling]

29
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,935
Father was not pleased about that.

30
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,937
Well, while Coran is picking up his
lenses...

31
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,064
I'll take you shopping
for something sparkly.

32
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
This isn't shopping!

33
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,151
You're not wandering around saying...

34
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,195
"What a lovely pink hat!
This is so becoming."

35
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,823
No! I can't allow Allura
to get anywhere near those...

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,284
filthy, lowballing Unilu hoodlums.

37
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,327
But I'd love something sparkly.

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,497
Look, you're the only one
who can operate the Castle.

39
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,375
You need to be resting,
after all you've been through.

40
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,335
Now, let's ready a pod for our mission.

41
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,420
We need to get in...

42
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,006
find the scaultrite lenses,
and just get out.

43
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,215
Shotgun!

44
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,051
What? No, you have to be
in the pod bay to call shotgun.

45
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,469
[Lance] Since when?

46
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,930
[Hunk] Since forever?
That's shotgun etiquette!

47
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,056
I wrote the book.

48
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,602
While they're doing that,
I'm going to head down to the hangar.

49
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,062
I need to strengthen my bond
with the Black Lion.

50
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,232
[sighing]

51
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,028
So what am I supposed to do now,
sit around and worry all day?

52
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,571
-[mice squeaking]
-Hmm?

53
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,367
What? Dinner and a show?

54
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,373
You and I have some work to do.

55
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,674
[exhaling]

56
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,932
Work with me.

57
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,643
What do I have to do
to strengthen our bond?

58
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,772
[gasping]

59
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,232
[Shiro] Whoa! Hey!

60
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,524
What are you doing?

61
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,029
Stop. Stop!

62
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,032
I said stop!

63
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,076
Turn around.
That's an order!

64
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,127
[Coran] Hello? Back passengers?
Can you hear me?

65
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,588
[Lance] Oh, it's so comfy up here.

66
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,966
Extra leg-room, heated seats!
Oh, man!

67
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,135
Stupid Lance.
Stupid shotgun.

68
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,763
Now, these swap moons
are very dangerous environments.

69
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,014
So be on your toes.

70
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,017
No weapons or communication devices
of any kind!

71
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,561
Also, I've brought along some disguises.

72
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,480
[Pidge] Hmm?

73
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,619
[Pidge] Uh, Coran?

74
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,456
This Unilu swap meet looks
an awful lot like a regular mall.

75
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,126
It does seem to be a little cleaner
than I remember.

76
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,629
Still, be vigilant. The Unilu are
cut-throat wheeler-dealers.

77
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,923
So keep your hands on your coin satchels.

78
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,758
My satchels are empty.

79
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,926
Good.

80
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,678
Let's just get this over with.

81
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,887
Yes, right.

82
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,516
Everyone, let's fan out,
search the area for teludav lenses.

83
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,728
We'll meet by the giant ticking clock
here in one vaga.

84
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,188
Don't be late, and try to blend in.

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,613
[screen beeping]

87
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,161
Huh? What the...

88
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,622
Space pirates!

89
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,374
Disguising yourselves
as harmless shoppers, huh?

90
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,251
Well, it won't work.

91
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,420
Don't worry, Emperor Zarkon.

92
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,506
I know you can't be here
to protect the mall...

93
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,968
but your faithful number two
is on the case.

94
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,932
Hope you pirates are ready to face Varkon.

95
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,684
[Shiro groaning]
Come on!

96
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,269
[groaning]

97
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,813
I don't know where you're headed...

98
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,113
but you need to
start listening to me right now!

99
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,996
That's better.

100
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,792
Where are we?

101
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,543
Why did you bring me here?

102
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,378
What are you trying to tell me?

103
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,801
[gasping]

104
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,818
So you want me to see through your eyes.

105
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,611
[gasping]

106
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,249
Was this your home?

107
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,460
Okay, if I were a 10,000-year-old
wormhole lens, where would I be?

108
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,337
Excuse me, hey, hi, excuse me, hi!

109
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,631
Wow, you guys are really booking here.

110
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,550
So I was just wondering if you guys
knew where I could find...

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,761
some lenses for my ship around here?

112
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,930
Is there a one-hour lens place
around here or something?

113
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,683
Anything? Nothing?
Never mind, you know what?

114
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,686
I'll catch up with you guys later!
[panting]

115
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,646
Huh?

116
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,735
Oh!

117
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,488
This... is... beautiful!

118
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,782
[chuckling]

119
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,953
Maybe the scaultrite is under
these samples. I don't know.

120
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,290
Rubbery.

121
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,464
Sweet and salty.

122
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,425
So cold, but spicy.

123
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,759
Mmm, eh...

124
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,303
What's next, what do you got?

125
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,305
[Vrepit Sal] Five hundred GAC.

126
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,850
Five hundred GAC.
Excuse me?

127
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,519
Sustenance provided by Vrepit Sal,
that's me.

128
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,689
Five hundred GAC is now owed.

129
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,773
I thought this was
a "free sample" situation.

130
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,066
Free?

131
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,318
Of charge.

132
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,904
You know, gratis?

133
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,072
Look, I don't have any money.

134
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,202
So, you know...

135
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,038
Oh, man!

136
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:21,375
How long you been here?

137
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,212
Sal put me in
when I was just a little girl.

138
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,887
Oh, no!

139
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,807
Let me show you this wonderful workings
of the Galasu X-90 Extreme Blade System.

140
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,684
It slices, it dices, it kills,
slaughters, and skins...

141
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,855
and constantly stays razor sharp!

142
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,322
Look at it cut through this bloato fruit.

143
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,032
Paper thin.

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,369
How much would you pay
for this knife?

145
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,497
But wait, there's more!

146
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,457
How many times have you had to fight off
a charging rock monster...

147
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,042
and then go immediately to a picnic?

148
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,256
All the time, right?

149
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,509
The Galasu can cut through rocks
and still cut bloato fruit paper thin.

150
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,843
Now how much would you pay?

151
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,845
Seriously, how much?

152
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,806
I have a lot of these to unload.

153
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
I just had a question.

154
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,019
Fine! What do you got?

155
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,527
Have you ever come across
something like this?

156
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,112
Whoa, this craftsmanship is incredible!

157
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,574
And is this a luxite blade?

158
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,825
The planet they mine that from
hasn't existed in decafebes.

159
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,785
Where'd you get this?

160
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,662
Someone gave it to me.

161
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,331
Okay, that's vague.
Tell you what...

162
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll give you 1,000 GAC
to take it off your hands.

163
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,501
It's not for sale.

164
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,962
Two thousand.

165
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,505
No, thanks.
Give it back.

166
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,258
How about this?

167
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,509
I keep the knife
and you beat it before security gets here.

168
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,844
I know it's stolen.

169
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,096
It's not stolen.

170
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,514
Then tell me where you got it.

171
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,433

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,368
It's one of those pirates!

179
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,873
I knew they looked edgy.

180
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,172
Varkon's comin' for ya!

181
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,215
[hoverbike whirring]

182
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,442
[Shiro]
So this was Zarkon's home planet.

183
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,944
Show me more.

184
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,156
[Shiro] King Alfor built you
from that comet.

185
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,451
And you fought beside him.

186
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,708
With Zarkon.

187
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,048
[gasping]

188
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,147
You!

189
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
[mice squeaking]

190
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,735
[giggling]

191
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,694
Absolutely stunning!

192
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,656
After we defeat Zarkon,
I'm taking you on the road!

193
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,664
[mice squeaking]

194
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,543
"

195
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,676
Mmm... Mmm?

196
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,263
[toilet flushing]

197
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,641
I'll just hold it.

198
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,019
[giggling]

199
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,813
Can I interest you in
the latest Earth fashions?

200
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,607
Lance, come on! We have to be back
at the ticking clock in a half hour.

201
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,027
But Pidge, wait, look at all this
crazy Earth stuff this alien is selling!

202
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,655
We're supposed to be looking
for the teludav lenses...

203
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,533
and you're looking in the one store
we know for certain won't have--

204
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,577
Oh, my gosh!
Is that Killbot Phantasm 1?

205
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,328
The first journey to the depths
of the demon sphere?

206
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh! Mercury Gameflux Two!

207
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,958
With the original power glove
that gives you infinite lives

208
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,084
if you touch the index finger
to the pinky!

209
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,963
We have to have this!
How much is this?

210
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,382
Twelve hundred GAC.

211
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,009
Is that a lot?

212
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,555
Well, compared to what we have,
which is none, yes. It's a lot.

213
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,724
We're gonna find some money.
Come on!

214
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,767
Don't sell that!

215
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,062
Don't worry.
I never sell anything.

216
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,358
Do I, Kaltenecker?

217
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,320
[Kaltenecker mooing]

218
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,282
Ah, one of the Unilu.

219
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,825
[whistling]

220
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,871
Um, like, can I help you?

221
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,083
Yes. Can you tell me
where the "other" market is?

222
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,213
The what?

223
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,924
Well, some might call it
the "black market."

224
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,885
Um, I don't think I know that.
Maybe check there.

225
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,304
I don't think this would be "on" the map.

226
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,557
It might be more "off-book."

227
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,685
Hm?

228
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,479
Maybe this will help you remember?

229
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,149
Again, what?

230
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,151
Ah, the old Unilu shakedown, eh?

231
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,237
[chuckling]
Fine.

232
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,113
Starting to get
a fuzzy recollection yet?

233
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,200
Who is this?

234
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,786
-Is this you?
-No!

235
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,830
That's King Groggery the Infirm!

236
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,000
You know what?
I'll find it myself!

237
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,837
[groaning]
I'm so out of this dump.

238
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,548
I gotta escape somehow.

239
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,053
Maybe I can scrub through these cuffs.

240
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,556
[horn blows]

241
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,225
Forty-three!

242
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,726
Sustenance unit complete.

243
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,311
-Ingest.
-[moaning]

244
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,313
-[explosion]
-Huh?

245
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,857
[robot buzzing]

246
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,150
Oh, not again!

247
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,235
Now who will be
my sustenance preparer?

248
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,571
I got this, Sal.
Un-cuff me.

249
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,948
[chuckling]
You?

250
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,868
Trust me.

251
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,204
I'm an enthusiastic gourmand
with an incredible palate.

252
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,333
Also, your robot is dead on the floor.

253
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,878
Hmm. That last part is true.

254
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,504
All right, work.

255
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,095
Okay, now watch this!

256
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,848
I can't read this.

257
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,183
Doesn't matter.
I'll just improvise.

258
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,020
Do you smell how the tanginess
of tuber masture really brings out...

259
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,524
the charred flavor
from the palmagoren fillet?

260
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,528
No, no, we won't be using that.

261
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,282
Let's just say,
"Number 44? Your order's up."

262
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,910
Enjoy your meal.

263
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,624
[moaning]

264
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,630
What did you do to her face?
It's cracking!

265
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,886
She's smiling!
She's enjoying her food.

266
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,680
Okay, let's provide some sustenance!

267
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,938
Show me more.

268
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,273
Those wings...

269
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,527
You have powers I haven't unlocked.

270
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,492
Incredible!

271
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,288
I've got you now, paladin.

272
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,459
[screaming]

273
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,003
You are a fool to face me here.

274
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,551
When you die in this realm,
your body dies as well.

275
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,054
And then I will take control of Voltron.

276
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,642
[grunting]

277
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,441

[breathing heavily]

281
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,707
I'll find you pirates!

282
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,583
[hoverbike beeping]

283
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,252
What's going on here?

284
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,254
Official business, excuse me,
this is a fire hazard.

285
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm in the middle of a hot pursuit.

286
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,508
I said "over medium".

287
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,010
Over medium, you rube!

288
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,054
Does this look over medium to you?

289
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,514
No, Chef.

290
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,765
Then let's get it right, huh?

291
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,647
If it ain't perfect, it ain't coming out
of this kitchen, people!

292
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,941
Sauce me!

293
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,026
Now you're getting it!

294
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,152
-Bon appÃ©tit.
-[applause]

295
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,403
I got you now, pirate!

296
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,321
Where are your friends?

297
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,453
[screaming]

298
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,205
Don't forget what I taught you!

299
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,833
Those are the fundamentals of cooking!

300
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,002
That kid is a genius.

301
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:30,466
I don't care if we have to search
the entire galaxy!

302
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,051
I want him back at Vrepit Sal's!

303
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,015
[Shiro panting]

304
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,559
You could never take my place
as the head of Voltron.

00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,895
-[yelling]
-[grunting]

306
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,314
You can't pilot the Black Lion
after everything you've done!

307
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,735
You can never lead Voltron again!

308
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,821
You're no paladin!

309
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,281
[groaning]

310
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,827
You have no idea how to command
a weapon like this!

311
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,749
No one commands the Black Lion!

312
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:11,548
[grunting]

313
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,134
You dare lecture me?

00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,430
[gasping]

315
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,848
Do you think the Black Lion would allow
such a feeble creature to pilot it?

316
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,142
Only the powerful can command it.

317
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,479
You've forgotten what's most important
between a lion and its paladin.

318
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,191
It's not about power.

319
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,527
It's about earning each other's trust.

320
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,783
Trust has nothing to do with it.

321
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,910
The lion is mine, forever.

322
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,370
[screaming]

323
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,124

00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,629
No!

326
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,260
Sire, what is it?

327
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,386
My connection grows weaker.

328
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,638
We must hurry
if we ever wish to reclaim Voltron!

329
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,597
Did you just save me?

330
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,728
Thank you.

331
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,484
Let's go home.

00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,073
We never left.

335
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,491
Oh, this tenner looks like the last one.

336
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,910
So how much have we got?

337
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,874
Eleven hundred and ninety-six GAC.

338
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,250
We're so close!

339
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,710
Lance, look!

340
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,128
Already on it!

341
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,964
[dolphin sounds]

342
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,966
Yeah! Let's go!

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,510
[laughing]

344
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,720
Thanks!

345
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
Gotta hide!
Gotta hide!

348
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,394
Who?

[hoverbike beeping]

350
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,649
Pirate number two!

351
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,151
My lucky day!

352
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,986
[yelping]

353
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,113
Hold on.

354
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,698
With every purchase,
you get a free Kaltenecker.

355
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,994
Time to get moving, guys!

356
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,122
Security's on our tail!

357
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,498
There's the rest of the crew!

359
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,548
[panting]

360
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,055
Everyone up on Kaltenecker!

361
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,556
Did you buy a cow?

362
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,683
It was free with purchase!

363
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,185
[everyone screaming]

364
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,145
Hold on a tick, this looks familiar!

365
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,190
Oh, lookie-lookie.

366
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,317
An original Unilu swap shop!

367
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,402
[sighing]

368
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,238
Good eye, friend.

369
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,075
This shop's been in
my family since before the empire began.

370
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,830
Can I interest you in a butcher barrel?

371
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,624
Or perhaps a set of window breakers?

372
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,919
Teludav lenses! Yes!

373
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,587
I mean, I don't have any idea
what these pieces of junk are.

374
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,756
I see you've got your eye on these
antique glass table toppers here.

375
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,092
Well, they're pretty ugly.

376
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,677
But I do have an empty
curio cabinet for grotesqueries.

377
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,637
How much do you want?

378
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,556
How much have you got?

379
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,183
Oh, I have a handful of pocket lint.

380
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,560
I'll take your first-born child.

381
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,104
Te daré un pañuelo usado.

382
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,106
I might be able to throw in
a used handkerchief.

383
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,607
-I could accept your left foot.
-I'd be willing to sing you a song!

384
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,777
You become my butler for one year.

385
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,612
-Two Altean crown bills.
-Five Valuvium ingots.

386
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,956
Oh, would you accept an IOU?

387
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,499
Of course.
I'll just need some collateral.

388
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,167
Maybe ten Valuvium ingots!

389
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,712
Or how about this?
One Olkari flying cube.

390
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,755
-You've got a deal!
-[giggling]

391
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,757
-There he is!
-We gotta go, Coran!

392
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,759
[panting]

393
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,768
I got the scaultrite lenses!

394
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,273
Scaultrite?
Hold on a tick!

395
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,026
No take-backs!

396
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,944
Get back here!

397
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,571
[screaming]

398
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,324
Doggone it!
You better run!

399
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,743
Don't let me catch you
in my jurisdiction again, pirates!

400
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,579
Oh, so you can't follow us outside, huh?

401
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,457
[taunting, yelping]

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,626
[grunting]

403
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,754
That's one for Varkon.

404
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,422
We got our lenses!

405
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,716
Excellent! Now, we can
get the teludav up and running.

406
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,135
Where's Shiro?

407
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,930
What did you do?
Take a nap?

408
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,682
Not exactly.

409
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,602
Is that a cow?

410
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,813
Mm-hmm, his name is Kaltenecker.

411
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,775
[mooing]

412
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,611
So, did you find a way
to bond with your lion?

413
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,446
Yes, and we need to get moving.

414
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,614
We're headed for the
Blade of Marmora's headquarters.

415
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,993
I'll plot a course.

416
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,994
While you're doing that, I'm gonna
hook up the video game Lance and I bought.
