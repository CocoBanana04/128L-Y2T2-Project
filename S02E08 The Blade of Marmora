1
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,570
[Shiro]
Coran...

2
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,865
How soon will we get
to the Blade of Marmora's base?

3
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,658
Based on the coordinates
that Ulaz gave us,

4
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,994
we should be there
within a few doboshes.

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,329
I can't wait to see it!

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,917
I mean, they were able to fold space-time,
and that was just at an outpost!

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,587
-Mm, the space taco. It left us too soon.
-[stomach grumbles]

8
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,549
Well, sure, but my point is, imagine
how amazing their home base will be!

9
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,635
Exactly. It could take on any shape.

10
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,554
Like a space jelly donut.
Or long, like a space Ã©clair.

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,890
Or a space cheese blintz
with a cherry sauce on top.

12
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,643
Maybe a little dusting of powdered sugar.
That's the stars.

13
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,103
Aw! Now, I'm hungry for breakfast.

14
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,732
Guys, this is a serious mission.
We need to focus.

15
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,235
[mockingly]
"We need to focus."

16
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,905
-[Coran] The base is in range.
-Take us in slowly.

17
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,617
[Coran] That might prove
the tiniest bit of a challenge.

18
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,290
[Hunk] Is that a black hole?
[Coran] No, no, no, no, no.

19
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,045
It's two black holes
and a giant blue star.

20
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
[Hunk]
That's not better.

21
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,341
No kidding. Just inside a black hole,

22
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,137
the temperature is one millionth
of a degree above absolute zero.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,598
But, just outside of that, it's hundreds
of millions of degrees Celsius.

24
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,727
Okay, it's like when you try to nuke
a frozen burrito in the microwave,

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,479
and it comes out
all scorching hot on the outside,

26
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,231
but it's still frozen
in the middle, right?

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,524
Now, I'm hungry for lunch!

28
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,611
Guys, quiet!
Coran, where's the base located?

29
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,532
In between those three
deadly celestial objects.

30
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,286
-The perfect defensive position.
-Or the perfect trap.

31
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,955
Yeah, I'm with Allura. Maybe
we shouldn't, like, go in there at all?

32
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,624
What are you talking about?
We have to go in!

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,753
This is the whole reason we came out here!
There is no other option!

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,340
*

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,011
Okay. Jeez. Calm down.

36
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,305
[electronic beeping]

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,767
[female computer voice]
Identify yourself.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:09,147
Open a hailing frequency, Coran.

39
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,952
We are the Paladins of Voltron,
sent here by Ulaz.

40
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,249
Two may enter. Come unarmed.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,335
Why would they insist we come unarmed?
Shiro, this doesn't feel right.

42
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,546
We've come too far to turn back now.

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,299
They just sent us a route to the base,
but we'll have to move quickly.

44
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,384
Because of the solar flares,
it's only open for another varga.

45
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,430
Then, it will be closed for two quintants.

46
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,348
-They're gonna close it for two years?
-Two days.

47
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,392
Oh.

48
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,102
So, any thoughts on who's gonna join you
on this little mission?

49
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,605
I'm thinking things
might get a little hot,

50
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,857
so you're gonna want someone
who can stay cool.

51
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,237
You're right.
Keith, you're coming with me.

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,448
Keith's a hothead! He's probably going
to shoot first and ask questions later!

53
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,536
And they're not gonna be able to answer
his questions because they'll be dead!

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,121
We haven't yet severed
Zarkon's link with the Black Lion,

55
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,499
so it has to stay here.

56
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,459
And the Red Lion can withstand
the heat from that sun.

57
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,837
So, yes, it'll be Keith.

58
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,132
[Coran] The course to the base will be
quite treacherous, to say the least.

59
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,467
You're walking a razor's edge between
the gravitational pull of the black holes

60
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,097
and the sun.

61
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,444
One false move, and you'll either be
crushed into infinity or burnt to a crisp.

62
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,155
-Keith, is everything okay?
-I'm fine.

63
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,200
You kind of blew up
at everybody back there.

64
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,120
You'll have to control your emotions if
you're going to lead this group someday.

65
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,207
[chuckles]
Lead the group?

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,709
When we were stranded, I told you,
if anything ever happens to me,

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
I want you to lead Voltron.

68
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,963
I thought you were just
delirious with pain.

69
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:01,718
Why would you make me the leader?

70
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,138
Because I know what you're capable of,
if you can learn some self-discipline.

71
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,725
Why are we even talking about this?
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

72
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,644
It's just in case.
I need you to get focused.

73
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,522
When you and Allura ran off,
it put us all in jeopardy.

74
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,443
If you're going to be a leader,
you've got to get your head on straight.

75
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,446
I'm sorry. I've just had a lot on my mind.

76
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,823
I know. We all have.

77
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,576
-[grunts]
-[alarm blaring]

78
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,660
[Keith] We're getting drawn in
by one of the black holes!

79
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,094
Get us out of here!

80
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,828
Great job! That was close.

81
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,455
There's nothing here. This place
just looks like a plain asteroid.

82
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:58,751
[loud rumbling]

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,867
I am going to ask you some questions.
I will know if you lie.

84
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,788
I am Kolivan,
leader of the Blade of Marmora.

85
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,458
My name is Shiro and this is Keith.
We are Paladins of Voltron.

86
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,252
[Kolivan] I know who you are.

87
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,297
[Shiro] Then you know we were sent
by one of your own.

88
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,259
[Kolivan] Ulaz was a fool to divulge
this location to you.

89
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,178
He had a penchant for ignoring orders
and following his impulses.

90
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,514
That's what got him killed.

91
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,185
�

92
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,020
He gave his life to save us!

93
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,690
What he did brought us here today,
and Voltron is ready to assist you.

94
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,568
Are we welcome here or not?

95
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,321
You were told to come unarmed.

96
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,114
You also told us to identify ourselves.

97
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,450
The lions are about as close
as we come to an ID.

98
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:17,622
If anything happens, believe me,

99
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,792
you'll be happy you have
the Red Lion on your side.

100
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,002
I imagine we would.
However, I wasn't referring to your beast.

101
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:29,091
[grunting]

102
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,011
Keith!

103
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,013
He has one of our blades!
Who did you steal this from?

104
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,765
I didn't! I've had it all my life!

105
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,351
[guard] Lies!

106
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,521
[Kolivan] Can you corroborate
your friend's statement?

107
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,692
Does this blade truly belong to him?

108
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,320
[Shiro] I... I don't know.

109
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:53,282
Shiro, you know me.
I promise you I didn't steal it.

110
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,452
I've had this knife
as long as I can remember.

111
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,873
-We can't trust them.
-I'm telling the truth.

112
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,210
I saw Ulaz had a knife like this.
Tell me what it means.

113
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:13,302
Our organization is built
on secrecy and trust.

114
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,265
You two should leave. Now.

115
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:21,769
We came here to form an alliance,
but obviously, we're not welcome.

116
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,523
-Come on, Keith, we're leaving.
-Not without some answers.

117
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,026
Somehow, one of your knives ended up
with me on planet Earth. Tell me how.

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,116
[Kolivan] Your friend is right.
It is time for you to go.

119
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,829
Where did it come from?
I have to know.

120
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:45,209
You seek knowledge? There is only
one way to attain knowledge here.

121
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,294
-How? I'll do it!
-The trials of Marmora.

122
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,630
Should you survive, you may keep the blade
and its secrets will be revealed.

123
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,926
Survive?

124
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,763
Keith, this is crazy. If they're not going
to help us, let's get out of here.

125
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,186
I'm not going anywhere. I have to do this.

126
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,813
Antok, give the boy the blade.

127
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,860
We will meet again.

128
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,654
Can't wait.

129
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,877
These trials result in one of two things.

130
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,630
Knowledge or death.

131
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,342
Surrender the blade.

132
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,761
You cannot win.

133
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,395
[growls]

134
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,525
[grunting]

135
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,696
[Keith grunting]

136
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:03,037
[screams, groans]

137
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,707
a

138
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,960
Come on, Keith.

139
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,004
[grunts, groans]

140
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,597
Surrender the blade
and the pain will cease.

141
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,500
I won't quit.

142
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,879
Then the pain continues.

143
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,548
You are not meant
to go through that door.

144
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,387
This is not a fair fight!

145
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,055
Nor is taking on the Galra,
yet that is the fight we face.

146
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,350
[screams]

147
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,403
Surrender the blade
and the pain will cease.

148
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,371
Never!

149
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,833
You are not meant
to go through that door.

150
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,129
[breathing heavily]

151
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,590
[Shiro]
How long does this go on?

152
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,924
Sometimes, the greatest challenge
is knowing when to stop.

153
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,472
-He'll never quit.
-One way or another, this will end.

154
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,973
Knowledge or death.

155
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,768
[yells]

156
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,356
-[Allura] How long has it been?
-Roughly ten vargas.

157
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,775
We cannot just wait here.

158
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,487
The path is closed for, like,
I don't know, 30 more vargas or something?

159
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,447
-That's actually correct.
-Really?

160
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,533
Yeah, I wasn't born yester-quintant.

161
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,535
I-I have to know
what's going on down there.

162
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,412
There's no way to get
a read on their base.

163
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,915
Too much interference
from the solar flares and the black holes.

164
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,625
If we account
for the gravitational lensing,

165
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,839
maybe we can reduce
the noise and interference

166
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,424
and connect with
the Red Lion's sensors, right?

167
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,602
Th-That's right, right?

168
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,106
-Are you looking at me?
-We can give it a try.

169
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,576
Get on it.

170
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,506
-[electronic beeping]
-[metal clanging]

171
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,688
Haggar wishes to speak with you.

172
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,199
[breathing heavily]

173
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,599
[grunts]

174
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,101
Keith!

175
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,272
Guess I really wasn't supposed
to go through that door. [groans]

176
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,902
Hey, man. You did it.

177
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,780
Shiro?

178
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,199
[grunting]

179
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,286
Kolivan told me you lasted longer
than anyone ever has in those battles.

180
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,333
-You don't have to keep this up.
-What are you talking about?

181
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,961
Just give them the knife
and let's get out of here.

182
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,923
I can't give it to them, Shiro.

183
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:28,552
Is that a hologram?

184
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,638
His suit has the ability to create
a virtual mindscape,

185
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,475
reflecting its wearer's greatest
hopes and fears.

186
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,810
And, at this moment, your friend
desperately wants to see you.

187
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,856
What is it with you and that thing?

188
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,399
It's the only connection
I have to my past.

189
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,071
It's my chance to learn who I really am.

190
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,323
You know exactly who you are,
a Paladin of Voltron.

191
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,576
We're all the family you need.

192
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,080
Shiro, you're like a brother to me...

193
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,499
but I have to do this.

194
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,462
No, you don't.
So, just give them the knife.

195
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,299
-I can't do that.
-Just give up the knife, Keith!

196
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,141
You're only thinking of yourself,
as usual!

197
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,151
I've made my choice.

198
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,236
Then you've chosen to be alone.

199
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,072
Shiro! Wait!

200
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,993
-[loud rumbling]
-Huh? Huh...

201
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,247
[man]
Keith...

202
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,040
[gasps]
Dad?

203
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:44,128
You're home, son.

204
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,548
-[loud rumbling]
-What's going on outside?

205
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,801
Don't worry about that.

206
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,554
We'll be fine as long as we stay in here.
Don't you want to catch up?

207
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,055
Of course I do.

208
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,808
[sighs]
Son, so many years have passed.

209
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,311
- I have so much to tell you.
-[loud rumbling]

210
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,737
What is that?

211
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,699
Everything's fine.

212
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:18,662
[gasps]

213
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,913
[people screaming]

214
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,874
Dad, I-I'm sorry. I gotta go.
There's people that need me out there.

215
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,716
Don't you want to know about where
you came from? Your mother gave it to me.

216
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,720
Mom?

217
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,062
-[loud rumbling]
-[people screaming]

218
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,731
She'll be here soon.

219
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,650
[grunting]

220
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,571
-You need to get him out of there.
-He can decide when to leave.

221
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,908
You're messing with his mind.
You're going to kill him!

222
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,871
Knowledge or death, Shiro.

223
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm calling this off.

224
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,337
[groaning]

225
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,929
You gotta tell me, Dad.
I have to know.

226
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,350
Where did the knife come from?
What does it mean?

227
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,111
Your mother is almost here.
She'll tell you everything.

228
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,160
I can't wait around anymore. I have to go.

229
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,289
If you go out that door,
you'll never find out who you are.

230
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,542
Goodbye, Dad.

231
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:57,970
[roars]

232
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,391
-The Red Lion is moving!
-We gotta get down there!

233
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,227


234
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,314
[Hunk]
It won't be ready for five more minutes.

235
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,024
I am going to ask you some questions.
I will know if you lie.

236
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,988
I have reason to believe that a spy
has infiltrated Galra command.

237
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,032
That is very alarming.

238
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,701
Indeed. Are you aware
of any spies within our ranks?

239
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,744
No.

240
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:28,625
Commander Thace,

241
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,382
are you the one
who lowered the solar barrier

242
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,262
during the Voltron attack,

243
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,858
allowing it to escape?

244
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,824
No. I fight in the name of Galra.
I am loyal to Zarkon.

245
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,950
You will help me root out this traitor.

246
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,248
We will destroy him
and all who threaten our reign.

247
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,500
The Red Lion is attacking the base!
It's trying to break through!

248
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,796
It has a link with Keith. It knows
when he's in danger. It's coming for him.

249
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,717
[all grunt]

250
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,428
[electronic beeping]

251
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,265
The Red Lion has started attacking!

252
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,771
Wait, what does that mean?
Why would the lion attack? Unless...

253
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,982
-Allura?
-Everyone, stay focused.

254
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,364
[faint rumbling]

255
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,574
-[running footsteps approaching]
-[faint rumbling]

256
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,452
-Keith, are you okay?
-Stop what you're doing!

257
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,289
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

258
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,624
-Call off your beast!
-Move out of the way! We're leaving!

259
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,377
You're not leaving with that blade.

260
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,712
It does not belong to you.
You failed to awaken it!

261
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,506
-What does that mean?
-Give up the blade!

262
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,593
[grunts]

263
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,684
Coran, how much longer
until we can get in?

264
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,437
Just a few more ticks, Princess.

265
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,525
Get ready.

266
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,736
Wait! Just take the knife!

267
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,740
It doesn't matter where I come from.
I know who I am.

268
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:40,632
We all need to work together
to defeat Zarkon.

269
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,176
If that means I give up
this knife, fine. Take it.

270
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,762
Mm?

271
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,806
You've awoken the blade!

272
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,891
The only way this is possible
is if Galra blood runs through your veins.

273
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,727
[Coran]
Five...

274
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,604
four...

275
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,898
three...

276
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,319
two...

277
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,385
one!

278
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,096
[Shiro]
Princess, we're coming back,

279
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,435
and we're bringing someone
you should meet.

280
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,188
-They're all right!
-Yes, they did it!

281
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:40,317
Princess Allura, it's good to see
that the rumors are true.

282
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,985
You're still alive after all these years.

283
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,821
So is Zarkon. Can we consider you
our ally in the fight against him?

284
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,448
Yes, but we have little time
to discuss this.

285
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,158
I just received word from our spy
inside the Galran hierarchy.

286
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,159
They have become aware of our presence,
