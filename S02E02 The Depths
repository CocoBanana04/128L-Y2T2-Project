00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,813
[Pidge screaming]

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,482
What just happened?

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:10,278
-I don't know, but we gotta stay together.
-[both screaming]

4
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,243
[both screaming]

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,620
-[beeping]
-[loud crash]

6
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,580
[water bubbling]

7
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,922
-[alarm blaring]
-[groaning]

8
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,926
-Hunk, you okay? Hunk?
-[retching]

9
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,303
-I'm fine.
-You just threw up, didn't you?

10
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:39,015
Yeah. You would too if you got sucked
out of a wormhole at light speed,

11
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,601
then crash-landed on an ice planet
and ended up underwater.

12
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,604
-That is what happened to me!
-Oh, right.

13
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,526
My main system is down. The crash must
have screwed it up. Does yours work?

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,987
I'm on reserve power.
My lion's pretty much dead in the water.

15
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,075
[groans] This situation's bad enough,
Hunk. Don't make it worse with puns.

16
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:01,621
[Hunk] I'm just shocked we hit a planet.
I thought Pidge said space was 90% empty.

17
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,207
[Lance] Well, apparently,
Pidge's science is wrong.

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,920
[Hunk] We need to contact the others
and get back to group immediately.

19
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,965
Hello, anyone? This is Hunk and Lance
of the Yellow and Blue Lions.

20
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,343
-Die kennen doch die Farben unserer LÃ¶wen.
-Richtig. Ok, ja.

21
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,303
-They know the color of our lions!
-Oh, right. Okay, yeah.

22
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,308
I always forget that. My bad.

23
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,061
[groans]

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,354
We gotta check for damage
and get these lions running.

25
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,524
-Copy that.
-Oh, good.

26
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,571
The Blue Lion's coming back online now.
Welcome back, beautiful.

27
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,116
Uh...

28
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,868
Hunk, did... did you just see
something swim by?

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,208
What? No.

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,753
No way! This is going to sound crazy,
but I think I just saw a mermaid.

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,755
Oh, boy. Okay, how hard did you
bang your head when we hit the planet?

32
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,259
Dude, I'm serious!
[gasps]

33
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,178
Look! There it is again!
Hey, come here!

34
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,474
Where you going? Hey, slow down!

35
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,936
Lance, knock it off. We have to stay
focused and get to the others...

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,730
-You're outside of your lion. Great.
-I know we have to find the others.

37
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,650
I'm just saying maybe this thing can help.

38
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,570
Also, it's a mermaid. A mermaid!
Come on, let's find it.

39
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:19,115
No. No way. Nope. Not going out there.

40
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,910
Okay, you stay here,
by yourself, in the dark,

41
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,369
all alone in a lion
that's out of commission.

42
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,045
Don't leave me!

43
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,725
Come on!

44
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,519
I can't believe this!
We're really chasing a mermaid.

45
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,480
[giggling]

46
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,023
Hey, wait, wait, wait! We're friendly!

47
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,280
[both gasp]

48
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,490
[both]
Whoa!

49
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,200
-Hello.
-[both scream]

50
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,661
Welcome to my village.

51
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,373
Here, all are safe and warm.

52
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,669
[both scream]

53
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,173
Please, do not startle our guests.
I am Florona.

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,968
The almighty Queen Luxia, keeper of
our land, would love to meet with you.

55
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,095
Wait. How did your queen know
we were here?

56
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,438
Queen Luxia knows all.

57
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,192
Lance, I know this mermaid thing is
a dream of yours, but we really gotta go.

58
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,027
We will, big guy, we will,
but let's meet this queen first.

59
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,072
Besides, maybe she can help us.

60
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,574
And, if I just happen to find
the future Mrs. Blue Lion,

61
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,215
well, then that is all right with me.

62
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,261
Space travelers, I am Queen Luxia.

63
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,264
I welcome you to our village
as honored guests.

64
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,683
The honor's all ours.
I'm La-a-a-ance. [grunts]

65
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,145
Uh, Mrs. Queen,
Your Honor, Your Excellence,

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,065
I'm Hunk, and me and my buddy here,
we crash-landed on your lovely planet,

67
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,318
but we really need to get back in touch
with our friends who are in space.

68
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,196
Would you possibly have
any way of doing that?

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,492
Hunk, Lance,
puedo solucionarles todos los problemas.

70
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,954
Hunk, Lance,
I can solve all of your problems.

71
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,750
-Here, we are all safe and warm.
-You use magic, don't you?

72
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,962
I bet this castle's a ship.
This castle is a ship, am I right?

73
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,174
-Just don't say anything if I'm right.
-Here, I've brought you these.

74
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,550
The bubble coral will provide you
with all the air you need.

75
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,888
Whoa-ho-ho!

76
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:51,601
Thank you, Fish Queen.

77
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,687
Huh. Cool.

78
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,105
And rest assured, your space vessels
will be well protected.

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,694
Now, please, follow me.

80
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,990
What is that?

81
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,952
That is the giver of life to our people,
the Baku Garden.

82
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:16,626
When the waters froze over,
we were forced to live down here.

83
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,338
The garden provides us the warmth
and food we need to survive.

84
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,549
Because of it, we are taken care of.
Here, all are safe and warm.

85
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,598
[mermaids giggling]

86
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,517
[giggling]

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,477
Your Royalness-- [clears throat]
if I may, this food is amazing.

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,857
It's even better
than Balmeran cave bugs.

89
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,735
I'm glad you enjoy it.

90
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,742
It was picked fresh from the Baku Garden.
And I hope you enjoy the entertainment.

91
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,961

92
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:04,006
[sultry dance music playing]

93
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,144
Whoa.

94
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,438
So, about us getting in contact
with our friends... how can you help us?

95
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,858
Please, let's discuss that
after the dance.

96
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,695
Whoa, this dance is amazing. It's the...

97
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,322
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

98
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,826
I'm glad you enjoy it.
Put your mind at ease.

99
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,704
Let your consciousness drift
like the tide.

100
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,790
Yes, I will do that.

101
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,628
I... Were-- Weren't we just
talking about something?

102
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,007
You were just telling me
how much you like it here,

103
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,592
how much you wanted to stay forever.

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,889
Oh, that's right.
Here, we are all safe and warm.

105
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,480
Lance, I think
we should stay here forever.

106
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,112
Okay.

107
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,447
[snoring]

108
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,616
I don't need pants. I'm a mermaid.

109
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,080
Huh?

110
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,839
Who are...?

111
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,393
[snoring]

112
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,561
[snoring]

113
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,440
Leave him. We have to get out of here.

114
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,278
[sighs, smacks lips]

115
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,405
Hello?

116
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,329
-Good morning. Where am I?
-He's awake.

117
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,288
Why am I blindfolded?
Is this a game?

118
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,583
[gasps]
I like games.

119
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,126
Wait, where am I? Why am I blindfolded?
Is this a game? I hate games!

120
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,169
[grunts]

121
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,964
It's okay. You were mind-swished,
but now we want to--

122
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,215
Kill me? Think again!

123
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,759
[groans]

124
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,889
-[grunts]
-[screaming]

125
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,559
Wait! Come back!

126
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,311
[screams]

127
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,563
[screaming repeatedly]

128
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,232
Huh?

129
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,610
[laughing]

130
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,822
Aw!

131
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,408
[screaming]

132
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:40,329
-Don't hurt me!
-Please, we are not here to hurt you.

133
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,999
We brought you here to ask
for your help. I am Plaxum.

134
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,544
-Blumfump.
-Swirn.

135
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,047
Are you saying names, or is this some
kind of weird spell you're putting on me?

136
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,842
We believe you are our savior.

137
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,929
You guys think I'm your savior?
What do you want with me?

138
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
The queen is mind-swishing everyone,
controlling their thoughts.

139
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,521
We believe you can stop her.

140
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,524
[snoring]

141
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,777
[moans]

142
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,906
Lance? Lance, you around?

143
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,827
Lance?

144
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,455
Is everything all right?

145
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,999
I can't find Lance.
Also, there's a hole in our wall.

146
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,126
There was a break-in.
Those cave-dwellers must have taken him.

147
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,670
Them again? What should we do?

148
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,966
Those meddling mermaids are harmless,

149
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,719
but the air-breather could
prove troublesome

150
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,138
if he doesn't fall back
under our control.

151
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,976
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Who needs to fall
under our control? Is Lance gone?

152
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,938
-We gotta find Lance.
-And we will.

153
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:52,068
Don't worry your little mind about it.

154
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:58,491
But first, we need to sit down and eat,
talk, clear our heads.

155
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,660
No, I'm not really sure if I can eat
right now. If Lance has been taken...

156
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,330
[moans]
Oh, boy. That... That is good, though.

157
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:09,835
See? That's all you need.
Here, we are all safe and warm.

158
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,757
Okay.

159
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,219
They are going to come.

160
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,347
We must destroy what remains of their kind
and bring Lance under our control.

161
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,809
But first, Florona, you were in charge
of watching the air-breathers.

162
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,603
So, now, it is time for you
to take a swim in the garden.

163
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,231
Yes, My Queen.

164
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,691
Wait. Wait a minute. Okay.

165
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,903
You're trying to tell me the queen
is brainwashing people?

166
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,824
But she's so safe and warm.

167
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,994
[Swirn]
What do you remember from yesterday?

168
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,832
I remember we crashed,
saw the mermaids and the village,

169
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:52,545
then we had dinner,
and then, uh... we, uh...

170
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,048
You can't remember
because you were under her control.

171
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:01,470
Our theory is, the queen controls minds

172
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,849
by using her voice to strike certain
head switches in your ear pan.

173
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:09,145
And her magnetic stare locks on
to your eye-to-brain pathway plug.

174
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,729
Plus, her mind-control sonar is always
broadcasting through the waters.

175
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,483
Bong! Bong! Bong!

176
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,528
She trains her people to use hypnotic
movements to lull you under her control.

177
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,949
I do remember a dancer.

178
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,163
Good, because I haven't finished
my picture for that one.

179
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,583
But you see, she was infecting your brain!

180
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,918
Holy crow! I had a mind-controlling
brain infection! [yelps]

181
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,506
[Plaxum]
Sit.

182
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,176
[Blumfump] The entire village
is under the queen's mind control.

183
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,304
The only reason we aren't

184
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,680
is because we wear these jellyfish
that hide our brains from her powers.

185
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,309
It's like we have no brains whatsoever.

186
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:53,772
You can't control what doesn't exist.

187
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,027
Right. Of course.

188
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,196
-Our heads are completely empty.
-Yeah, I get it.

189
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,324
Many years ago, the queen froze over
the surface by blocking the thermal vents.

190
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,202
She forced everyone to the depths,
where she began to brainwash them.

191
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,621
They became her prisoners.

192
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,081
-What size?
-Eight and seven-eighths aquameters.

193
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,793
But what's the point?
Why mind-control the mermaids?

194
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:26,639
-To kill them!
-Really?

195
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,366
Well, we don't know that for sure,

196
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,162
but hundreds of mermaids
have disappeared and never come back.

197
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,915
Goodbye, Florona.
It is time to return to the giver of life.

198
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,918
[Swirn] We've tried to take out the queen,
but failed several times.

199
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,962
And every attempt depletes our numbers.
Now, there are only three of us left.

200
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,382
Without you, there is no hope.

201
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,300
-Found one!
-What do you want from me?

202
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,428
We saw the mer-cat you came in.

203
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,180
We think it can stand up
against the queen and her forces.

204
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,226
Pero antes, necesitas esto.

205
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,395
But first, you'll need one of these.

206
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,147
Now, they sting pretty bad
and don't smell great.

207
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,608
If my theory is correct,

208
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,819
the smelliest ones block
the most mind-control rays.

209
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,949
-Are you a scientist?
-No.

210
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,951
Also, they can sometimes
make your face swell,

211
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,619
and you might experience hearing loss.

212
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,789
Would you just put it on, already?

213
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
-[screams] It burns!
-That means it's working!

214
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,336
[groaning]

215
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,547
[mumbling]
So, what's the plan?

216
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,634
Here's what Blumfump came up with.

217
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,720
This is you.

218
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,556
You act like you're still thought-swirled
and get past the guards.

219
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,891
Get your mer-cat and grab the queen.

220
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,893
We'll mount a full-scale attack
on the castle and free the people.

221
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,686
Then, I'll be a hero.

222
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,438
[high voice]
"Oh, Lance, you're so handsome!"

223
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,064
[normal voice]
"And modest."

224
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,901
[high voice]
"Oh, thank you for saving us.

225
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,945
Can I kiss you?"

226
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,156
[normal voice]
"Maybe just a little."

227
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,283
[kissing noises]

228
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,078
Well, now, you're just
making a tree kiss a turtle.

229
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,373
That's a turtle?
But there's an actual turtle right here.

230
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,833
We needed the turtle to play the wall.

231
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,710
If your acting fails you,

232
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:24,298
this holds three doses of antidote
to use on the guards.

233
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,640
It should interrupt
the queen's mind-control long enough

234
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,684
pour te permettre de t'enfuir.

235
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,064
for you to escape.

236
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,233
I don't think I'll be needing this.

237
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,778
I missed 14 days of the third grade
for a stomachache I never really had.

238
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,990
Hello, mer-guards! Isn't everything
just so safe and warm here?

239
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,954
Anyway, I'm off to my lion--
Oh, come on!

240
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,539
[groans]

241
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,250
ï¿½

242
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,587
I had a feeling you'd come
for your vessel.

243
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,423
Servant, take Lance to the Baku Garden.

244
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,804
[gasps]
Hunk?

245
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,846
Hey, buddy, it's me!
Snap out of it! It's Lance!

246
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,140
[groans]

247
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,142
[yells]
Darn it!

248
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,981
[grunting]

249
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,525
Everyone, capture him!

250
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,319
[grunting]

251
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,114
[yells]

252
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,741
[groans]

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,619
[screams, whimpers]

254
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,329
[laughs, grunts]

255
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,876
[screams]

256
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,755
[groans]

257
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,049
[grunting]

258
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,344
Hunk, please! I don't want to hurt you!

259
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,889
Must keep Queen safe and warm.

260
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,977
[grunts]

261
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,439
[squeaking]

262
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,026
[groans]

263
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,362
[whimpering]

264
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,449
[grunting]

265
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,702
[moans]
Whoa!

266
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,121
Whoa! Where am I? What am I doing?
Is that a jellyfish on your head?

267
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,755
Hunk, you've been mind-controlled
by the queen and you're trying to kill me.

268
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,385
-Oh, really? Sorry. My bad.
-We're kind of in the middle of a battle.

269
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,306
-So, I'm going to need your help.
-Got it.

270
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,641
[Lance] Oh!
[Hunk] Uh...

271
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,021
-Uh... Uh...
-[gasps]

272
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,356
-[grunts]
-Huh?

273
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,609
[grunting]

274
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,861
[grunting]

275
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,654
-Now, who are these weirdos?
-Those weirdos are with us.

276
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,740
Come, we must hurry to your mer-cats.

277
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,326
[growls]

278
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,288
-[Lance] You hanging on?
-Yes! Let's go!

279
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,708
-What's the plan?
-We need to grab the queen

280
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,880
and take her to an ice prison
Blumfump built,

281
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,467
where her mind-control powers
will be trapped

282
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,974
because of the thick ice
and the jellyfish.

283
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,269
-Okay, who's that?
-It's Plaxum. Just go with it.

284
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,229
[Hunk]
There she is!

285
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,649
[grunting]

286
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,319
-[grunting]
-[groans]

287
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,030
[Lance]
Got her!

288
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,408
[groans]
Where am I? What's going on?

289
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,285
What's going on is you're not
mind-controlling these people anymore,

290
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,122
Your Majesty.

291
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,417
What? Mind-control? Me?

292
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,420
No! Please, my people are in danger!
You must go back!

293
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,714
-What's going on?
-[Plaxum] Nothing! It's a ruse.

294
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,635
-Are you sure?
-I wasn't controlling anyone.

295
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,514
[gasps]
The Baku!

296
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,016
-She's lying!
-I'm not. Please!

297
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,393
The last thing I remember is that organism
in the garden falling from space.

298
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:09,857
I went to inspect it.
I thought it was a plant.

299
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,275
[Hunk] Wait a second.
We've been eating that plant.

300
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,570
And it's delicious!
It's so safe and warm.

301
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,998
A-ha! Mind-swishing!
It was the plant the whole time.

302
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,668
And the queen was the first one
to be mind-controlled.

303
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,213
But why?

304
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,175
The Baku has been harvesting us all.
We are its food source.

305
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,596
No way!

306
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,853
I think she's telling the truth.
Look out the window.

307
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,980
[roars]

308
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,523
You two get somewhere safe.
Okay, Hunk, change of plans.

309
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,192
The queen is actually good
and that thing is bad. Let's take it out.

310
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,444
[roars]

311
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,946
[yelling]

312
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,907
That thing's too quick for me.
I can't hit it!

313
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,825
-My lion's not very good in water.
-Really?

314
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
My lion's moving better than ever.

315
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,747
There's something
about fighting underwater

316
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,835
that's making me feel
extra quick and powerful.

317
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,424
-I think I know how to stop that thing.
-How?

318
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,886
We gotta stop shooting
where the creature is

319
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,972
and start shooting
where the creature's gonna be.

320
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,061
[growling]

321
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,396
I got it!

322
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,399
[groaning, panting]

323
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,995
[roaring]

324
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,498
[Lance laughs]
Now, the hunter becomes--

325
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,501
-Oh, no, he's free!
-[yelling]

326
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,757
[screams, grunts]

327
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,057
[roars]

328
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,937
[creature screams]

329
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,235
-What?
-[electronic beeping]

330
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:23,115
Here goes nothing!

331
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,618
[roars]

332
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,121
[screaming]

333
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:33,417
[Lance] This place is coming down!
Let's get out of here!

334
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,005
[Hunk] Dude, you just dropped
a sonic boom on him!

335
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,466
[Lance] So, Blumfump, the jellyfish,
the magnetic stare, the hypnotic dance...

336
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,262
-You got it all wrong. It was the food.
-Well, I did say they were theories.

337
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,557
Mer-science isn't always about
getting the right answer.

338
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,600
I want to thank you all
for what you've done.

339
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,728
You've freed my people, and I will do
all I can to protect that freedom.

340
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,901
I vow to be the voice of my people.
I beg of you to help.

341
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,654
-Will you be my advisors?
-Of course, Your Highness.

342
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,157
I have some great ideas.
Have you ever heard of electricity?

343
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,491
And I wanted to personally
thank you, Lance.

344
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,288
-Mwah.
-[groans]

345
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,291
Finally, I can remove this thing.

346
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,044
Whoa!
[moaning]

347
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,588
Queen Luxia, the reason
we came here in the first place

348
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,390
was to see if you could help us
find our friends.

349
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,811
Of course.

350
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,104
It has been many years since we have
activated the energy beacon,

351
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,648
but perhaps it is time
to rebuild our civilization

352
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,151
and reach out
to interstellar travelers once again.

353
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,403
Activate energy beacon!

354
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,780
[Pidge]
I see the beacon!

355
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,781
There is a mer-cat in our system
that appears to be heading our way.
