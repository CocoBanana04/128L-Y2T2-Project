2
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,522
Hay que actuar rápido.
Tenemos 20 minutos.

3
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,733
[Shiro]
<span style="style_2"/>We've gotta act fast.

4
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,278
The power will only be down
for 20 minutes.

5
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:14,449
The Blade of Marmora's schematics
showed four targets we need to hit.

6
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,453
The weapons systems, the engines,
the bridge, and the shield generators.

7
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,621
Now, let's put an end to Zarkon,
once and for all.

8
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,790
[all]
Yeah!

9
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,884
Form sword!

10
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,429
[Zarkon] I want weapons systems
activated immediately!

11
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,733
Restart the entire crystal core manually
if you have to!

12
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,487
Our ship may be without power,
but we are not.

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,447
I can use the komar to draw
the quintessence directly from Voltron,

14
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,535
rendering him lifeless.

15
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,830
It is time I face Voltron myself.

16
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,624
No, lord! It is certain death!

17
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,836
Today, the Black Lion will be mine.

18
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,587
Your obsession with the Black Lion
is clouding your judgment!

19
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,093
You must not go out there!

20
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,345
Hurry! We need to protect our emperor.

21
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,650

<span style="style_2"/>Hit the engine systems!

23
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,323
We've done it.
This is the end of Zarkon's reign.

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,581
Yes, Princess.

25
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
[alarm blaring]

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,464
Ready my armor.

27
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,593
But, lord, it has never been
successfully tested.

28
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,579
To do--
[screams, groans]

29
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,644
Begin the ritual!

30
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,479
[Shiro] Stay focused.
We've neutralized the engines.

31
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,734
Let's target the bridge.

32
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,657

Oh, no.

Attack!

37
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,431
No!

00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,452
It's pure quintessence!

46
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:11,311
I thought the virus shut down
all of Zarkon's power!

47
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,729
That blast was not
from the ship's weapons.

48
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,441
-It was magic.
-It must have been the komar.

49
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,874
Zarkon has been trying to develop a device
to extract the quintessence from planets.

50
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,376
<span style="style.default_1">Es gelang wohl.</span>

51
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,463
It appears he succeeded.

52
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,716
Se destrói planetas,
o que fez com os paladinos?

53
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,637
[Coran] If it destroys planets,
what did it do to the paladins?

54
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,266
[Allura]
Paladins! Shiro! Can you hear me?

00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,187
[Shiro]
Yes, Princess. We're alive.

57
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,688
-Oh, thank the ancients!
-Is Voltron operational?

58
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,357
It's not working.

59
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,027
[grunts]
I can't move my lion.

60
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,215
You've been hit
with some kind of witchcraft

61
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,467
that draws the quintessence out of you.

62
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,304
You need to get out of there!

63
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,900
Another blast like that
and you may not survive!

64
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,027
Wait. What's that?

65
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,033
You must get moving.
Remember your training.

66
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,621
Remember all the battles
you've been through.

67
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,331
[grunts]
Voltron's still not responding.

68
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,341
[groaning]

69
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,845
[sighs]
It's Zarkon.

70
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,390
We must buy them more time.
Get us in closer.

71
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,776
-Divert all power to our weapons system.
-What? Princess, we'll be defenseless!

72
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,544
It's the only way.

73
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,216
Listen to me. You are true paladins now.

Connect with your lions,

Fight! This cannot end now!

77
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,787
Fire!

Allura!

80
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,383
Everybody, listen. We have to fight.
We have to channel all our energy.

81
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,677
Visualize five becoming one.

82
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,262
We have to focus everything we have
into moving Voltron.

85
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,102
We are the last thing standing in the way
of Zarkon's total universal domination.

86
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,271
I'm not giving up that fight!

87
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,524

-No.

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,571
Then let's get Voltron
back in this battle.

96
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,448
Now, I will take back what is mine!

97
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,620
Summon the energy again!
We must fight beside our emperor!

98
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,205
[Shiro] All right,
let's hit him with the big guns.

is the Castle damaged?

Our power levels are decimated.
Communications aren't working.

00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,082
We can't reach the paladins.
I'm afraid we can't fight anymore.

114
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,292
We cannot give up.

Did we win yet?

Coran, you and Slav do what you can
to get the Castle functioning again.

118
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,963
Kolivan, can you get me to the komar?

119
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,842
It will be dangerous, but I know a way.

-You and Antok come with me.
-[both grunt]

121
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,504
We're going to have to attack the witch
directly if we hope to stop that thing.

00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,138
Coran, the bridge is yours.

123
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,181
No! You've been weakened
by operating the teludav.

124
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,521
-You can't face Haggar directly!
-We don't have a choice.

125
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:16,545
We've never faced anything
this powerful before.

126
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,714
One way or another,
this may be our last battle.

127
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,468
We've got to give everything we have.
Dig deep and fight!
