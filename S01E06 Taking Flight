1
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:12,989
-I can't tell if he looks healthy or not.
-I think he's breathing weird.

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,909
-Oh, come on!
-Not yet! A few more ticks.

3
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,370
How much better do you think
he's gonna get in a few more ticks?

4
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,415
-And what exactly is a tick?
-You know, a time slice.

5
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,335
-Like a second?
-What is a "second"?

6
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,378
Like this.

7
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,509
-[clock beeping]
-I'm not sure. I think ticks are bigger.

8
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,303
-Coran, do you have a ticker?
-Right here, Princess.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,307
[ticker beeping]

10
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,559


11
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,521
I think ticks are a little slower.

12
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,773
I can't tell. We have to start them
at the same time.

13
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,441
Okay. Ready, go!

14
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,026
[both beeping]

15
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,822
Yes! I think we're winning.

16
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,823
Winning what? The intergalactic
time-measuring competition?

17
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,619
Yes.

18
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,331
You guys having a clock party?

19
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,457
Aw, Lance, you just ruined it.
Hey, Lance!

20
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,251
[grunts]

21
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:10,713
What happened?

22
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,843
We can tell you all about it while you get
something to eat. Are you able to walk?

23
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,177
Talking? Eating?
Are you asking me out on a date?

24
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,721
[both sigh]

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,765
�

26
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,434
-Yep, he's okay.
-Classic.

27
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,895
[mouse squeaking]

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,439
He'd be Sendak's prisoner right now,
if not for Pidge.

29
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,360
Well, you wouldn't have
survived the explosion

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,028
if Hunk and Coran hadn't
gotten a new crystal.

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,949
Wow. Thanks, everybody. Sounds like
the mice did more than you, though.

32
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,286
I punched Sendak!

33
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,373
Yeah, apparently after I emerged
from a coma and shot his arm off.

34
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:49,168
We had a bonding moment.
I cradled you in my arms!

35
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,005
Nope. Don't remember, didn't happen.
So, what happened to Sendak?

36
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,007
He's frozen in a cryo-pod.
We're keeping him here in the Castle.

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,386
[Lance]
Are you sure that's a good idea?

38
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,847
[Allura]
He's too dangerous to be set free.

39
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,392
Besides, we might be able to get
some information about Zarkon from him.

40
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,229
So, what's the plan now?

41
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,400
We have to get back to the Balmera
and save Shay and her people.

42
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,571
-Wow! You are really hung up on this lady.
-No, it's not like that.

43
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:20,742
Guys, when you see how Zarkon has treated
these people and destroyed their home--

44
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,535
They've been under his thumb for so long,
they don't know what it is to be free.

45
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,580
It's up to us to set this right.
This is what being a paladin is all about.

46
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,043
-It's time to man up.
-[mouse squeaks]

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,087
Then let's get moving.
Time to go defend the universe.

48
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:38,885
Wait, I have something to say first.
I need to come clean.

49
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,890
I'm afraid this may change
the way you all think about me.

50
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:48,061
Just so there are no secrets
between us anymore, I can't "man up."

51
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,481
I'm a girl. I mean, I can "man up"
because that's just a figure of speech.

52
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,026
I don't have to actually be a man
to "man up." I just have to be tough.

53
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,861
-But what I'm saying--
-Wha...? You're a girl? How?

54
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,405
I've known for some time, but I'm glad
you've shared it with everyone.

55
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,825
-Yeah, I figured.
-Oh, yeah, me too.

56
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,244
Wait, we were supposed
to think you were a boy?

57
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,248
Pidge, owning who you are is going
to make you a better paladin.

58
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,918
[sighs]

59
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,795
It's good to get that off my chest.
Now, let's launch this Castle-ship!

60
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,986
Wait, what? Pidge is a girl
and the Castle is a ship?

61
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,946
¿Por cuánto me desmayé?

62
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,618
How long have I been out?

63
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,622
Activate interlock.

64
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,542
Dynotherms connected.

65
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,955
Mega-thrusters are go.

66
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,416
We are ready to depart Planet Arus
on your mark, Princess.

67
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,377
[Allura]
Firing main engines for launch.

68
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,257
[male voice] Sire, if capturing Voltron is
the Empire's number-one priority,

69
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,345
then I suggest we begin
moving the main fleet

70
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,057
toward its last known location posthaste.

71
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,186
Lord, after many years,
the Komar experiment is finally ready.

72
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,522
Soon, we could have more quintessence
at our fingertips than ever imagined.

73
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,609
We must test it before moving the fleet.

74
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,779
We don't have time for any more
of your magic. We must move our ships now.

75
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,452
Voltron is the most
powerful weapon ever created.

76
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,662
His puny ships will never
be up to the task.

77
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,831
We must be well prepared
for our next encounter.

78
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,126
I know better than anyone
the power of Voltron.

79
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,799
Haggar has my trust.

80
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,593
We will perform her test.

81
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,684
The witch has his ear.

82
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,896
Keep sending our offer out to any scum
between Planet Arus and Balmera X-95-Vox.

83
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,732
I'll capture Voltron on my own.

84
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,819
So, when we get there, what do you think?
Do we just roll up and start blasting?

85
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,448
Or do we land and have some kind
of public address system, like,

86
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,034
"Attention, Galras, this is Voltron.
Turn yourselves in"?

87
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,662
No. Blasting, right?

88
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,288
Hunk, calm down. And, yes, blasting.

89
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,250
It's our first big rescue mission.
He's excited.

90
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,334
Excited to see his new girlfriend.

91
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,505
[gasps]
She's not my girlfriend!

92
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,092
She's just a rock that I met
and I admire very much.

93
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,053
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps]

94
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,265
y

95
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,560
-What is it? Are we being attacked?
-No, it seems to be a distress beacon.

96
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,814
It's coming from a nearby moon.
Apparently, a ship has lost power.

97
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,483
-I wonder who it is.
-Whoever it is will have to wait.

98
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,904
Shay has first priority.
We can check back on them when we're done.

99
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,989
The Paladin Code states
that we must help all those in need.

100
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,615
Wow! This is so cool. It's like
we're space cops on space patrol.

101
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,534
Coran, do we have a siren
we can turn on?

102
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,837
Uh, no, but we could record you making
a siren noise and broadcast that to them.

103
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,881
Perfect!

104
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,933
[imitates siren]

105
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,106
No, not doing that.

106
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,108
[over speakers] Attention, damaged craft,
this is Princess Allura.

107
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,194
We are coming to assist you.

108
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,411
Whoa. Nice ship.

109
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,455
Stay aboard and try to get
as many of our systems clear

110
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,832
of that Galra crystal energy as you can.

111
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,752
-We'll see who hailed us.
-Yes, Princess.

112
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,672
You don't know how glad we are
to see some friendly faces.

113
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,382
Most folks don't want to get tangled up

114
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,636
with anyone who's on the run
from the Galra.

115
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,888
So, you guys are fighting the Galra?

116
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,223
Well, I don't think Zarkon is exactly
quaking in his boots at the three of us,

117
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,891
but we do what we can.

118
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,309
I'm Rolo. This is Nyma,
and our cyber-unit, Beezer.

119
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,644
Hi.

120
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,356
[sighs]

121
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,903
[beeping]

122
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,114
[gasps]

123
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,534
Cool robot!

124
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,453
-Hi! Name's Lance.
-Was your ship damaged in a fight?

125
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,206
Yeah, we've really been through it
with the Galra. Parts are hard to come by.

126
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,627
Luckily, we were able to limp
to this moon about a week ago.

127
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,631
If you didn't pick up
our distress signal, I--

128
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,341
We're happy to help.
I am Princess Allura of Altea,

129
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,595
A partir de agora,
não estarão sozinhos na luta.

130
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:20,893
and from now on,
you won't be alone fighting the Galra.

131
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,604
You'll have the Paladins of Voltron
by your side.

132
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,691
[laughing]

133
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,361
Okay.

134
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,448
-I don't think they've heard of us.
-It has been ten thousand years.

135
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,160
Voltron? Five robot lions
that combine into this big robot... guy?

136
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,745
Sounds impressive. I'd love to see it.

137
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,248
-Or him. Them.
-Why don't we get to work on your ship?

138
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,168
-I'm sure we all have places to be.
-Sure.

139
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,086
Pretty much our whole
flaxum assembly is shot.

140
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,549
I don't know what kind of extra parts
you carry in this rig of yours.

141
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,845
I've never seen anything like it.

142
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,638
I'm sure we can get you
back up and running.

143
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,391
Give Hunk a list of what you need.
Coran can show you where to find it.

144
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,559
Okay.

145
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,855
We'll go with you. Don't want you to have
to carry all that yourself. Come on, guys.

146
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,109
Uh, I don't think so.
You can just wait out here.

147
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,819
Hunk, don't be rude.

148
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,239
Sí, qué modales con damas presentes.

149
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,327
Yeah, mind your manners.
There are ladies present.

150
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,039
-Hey.
-[Shiro sighs]

151
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,999
Oh, I'm sorry, but does anyone remember
the last time we let our defenses down?

152
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,254
Someone kind of set off a bomb.
Remember, Lance? You were almost killed.

153
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,050
Oh, yeah.

154
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,844
Hunk's right.
Sorry, but we have to be cautious.

155
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,930
Hey, I don't take it personal.
That's how it is out here.

156
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,021
You've got to look out for your own.
You're doing a good job, big man.

157
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,316
Yeah. Thanks.

158
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,318
My planet was destroyed by the Galra
and I was taken captive.

159
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,321
I managed to escape,
but not before I lost something.

160
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,114
I know exactly how that feels.

161
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,076
Well, I hope there are some parts
in here that'll fit.

162
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,662
-You know, to get your ship moving?
-Great! Thanks.

163
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,165
So, what can you tell us
about Zarkon's forces?

164
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,708
Where are they concentrated?

165
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,420
Well, his command ship sits
right in the center of the Empire.

166
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,882
He mostly calls the shots from there

167
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:19,220
and has his minions do the work,
depending on who's closest.

168
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,971
This is the territory
of a real nasty bugger named Sendak.

169
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,482
-Oh, we've met.
-How far are we from the center?

170
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,985
We're way out on the fringes.

171
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,988
Sorry to interrupt, but I think you guys
are kind of keeping Rolo from working.

172
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,950
It's just that we're in a hurry.
A hero named Shay saved my life,

173
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,493
and I swore I would return to do the same
for her and her people. You understand.

174
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,455
Sure. Sorry.

175
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,166
Hunk, we're going to get going soon,

176
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,920
but I think Rolo might have some
information that could be helpful to us.

177
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,589
I don't trust this guy
as far as I can throw him.

178
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,800
We ought to leave him with parts
and just say, "AdiÃ³s, amigo."

179
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,928
Hey, bud! Sorry,

180
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,805
but do you think you could hunt down
a length of thermal pipe about yay long?

181
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,559
[groans]
On the way.

182
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,978
So, are there more freedom fighters?

183
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,108
Any kind of organized resistance
to the Galra?

184
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,069
Only folks who haven't been colonized yet,

185
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,822
or the lucky few, like us,
who managed to escape somehow.

186
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,158
Well, we're going to change all that.

187
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,786
That's good to hear, but I've got
to warn you, it's pretty bad out there.

188
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,206
You don't know what you're up against.

189
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,877
I mean, there are only five of us
in the entire universe,

190
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,838
so I guess you could say
it's kind of a big deal.

191
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,507
I don't understand.
The lions are ships?

192
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:43,053
Are they, like, flying statues
that you ride on?

193
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,765
No, no, no. They're magic,
but also super scientific and advanced.

194
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,725
Vuelan muy rápido
y tienen armas increíbles.

195
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,146
And they fly crazy fast
and have all these incredible weapons.

196
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,940
Really, the entire Castle is just insane.
I wish you could see it.

197
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,694
Yes, it's too bad
we're not allowed inside.

198
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,988
I would love a tour
from one of the knights.

199
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,199
But I guess the big one is in charge, huh?
You have to obey his orders?

200
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,116
Who, Hunk? [scoffs]
I don't have to listen to him!

201
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,703
[giggles]

202
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,875
[gasps]
This place is incredible!

203
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,961
Yeah, I guess. You get used to it.

204
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,424
But it's so gigantic. It must take you
forever to get to your lion.

205
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,220
Ooh, you'd be surprised.

206
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,804
[both laughing, cheering]

207
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,808
Huh?

208
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,148
[both cheering]

209
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,985
Pretty slick, right?

210
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,238
Unbelievable!
Take me on a ride around the moon?

211
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,782
We should probably
get back to the others.

212
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,242
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe Keith will give me a ride.

213
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,710
No! Hold on a second!

214
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:05,219
What's the point of having the lion if you
can't enjoy it, right? Giddy-up, buddy!

215
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,976
Oh, Lance!

216
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,227
Let them have their fun. Thanks to you,
this thing is just about ready,

217
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,147
so we're going to be on our way soon.

218
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,066
Too many light years on that guy, I guess.

219
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,735
Yeah.

220
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,240
Begin the ritual.

221
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,577
Druids of the four directions, join us!

222
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,330
[yelling]

223
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:19,501
[Haggar]
The Komar experiment was a success.

224
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,175
We have gained
an entire planet's quintessence,

225
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,219
a feat that would have
normally taken us years.

226
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,933
Most impressive.

227
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,401
This will revolutionize the way
we advance throughout the galaxy.

228
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,780
Mining and colonizing planets
is a thing of the past.

229
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,782
With this much power
available at our whim,

230
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,504
we can now spend all of our time
hunting down and capturing Voltron.

231
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,216
[Nyma] Look, a kinetic spring!
Let's land over there.

232
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,510
The minerals reflect off the water,
making a rainbow.

233
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,144
Wow. Is there anything you don't know?

234
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,901
[grunts] I think this thing is just
about ready for a test flight.

235
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,326
Beezer, come co-pilot for me.
Be back in a tick.

236
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,300
Uh...

237
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,180
So, you want to see how fast
I can climb this tree?

238
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:59,101
[giggles]
Aw, you are cute.

239
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,897
Let me show you something.
Give me your hand.

240
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,614
Whoa. This is kind of...

241
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,034
[Beezer beeping]

242
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,538
-Nyma, what's going on?
-Sorry, Lance. Maybe we'll meet again.

243
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,958
Oh, quiznak!

244
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:23,959
-How many ticks have they been gone?
-I don't know.

245
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,337
-I hope they didn't break down again.
-Something ain't right.

246
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,380
[Lance straining]

247
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,341
Guys?

248
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,136
Hello? Little help?

249
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,015
Lance? Lance! Are you all right?
What's going on?

250
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,226
Well, I'm kind of chained to a tree.

251
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,352
I knew it!

252
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,605
And I think Nyma and Rolo
just stole the Blue Lion.

253
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,482
I knew it!

254
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,608
-Where are they?
-Uh, space?

255
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,360
Uh, I never trusted those guys,
right from the beginning!

256
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,863
At first, it was a feeling in my gut,
but when I was replacing that pipe,

257
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,531
the pipe was cracked, but none
of the hardware around it was damaged.

258
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,410
[Keith]
We get it!

259
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,289
If the thermal pipe is cracked,
then, obviously, hello,

260
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,543
the entire assembly
should be totally roasted.

261
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,630
D'accord, on a compris !

262
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,382
Okay! We get it.

263
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,720
We should've had to replace
the entire undercarriage of that reactor.

264
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,182
So, right then,
I was, like, positive. Foul play.

265
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,476
[all]
Okay, we get it!

266
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,437
[lions roaring]

267
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,232
Commander Prorok, my name is Rolo.

268
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,610
Ofrece recompensa por ayudar
a capturar los leones de Voltron.

269
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,861
I understand you're offering a reward to
anyone helping capture the Voltron Lions.

270
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,030
That's correct.
Do you know where they are?

271
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,365
I know where the blue one is.
It's in my ship.

272
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,408
Excellent. Bring it to me
and you'll have your reward immediately.

273
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,411
Just a tick. My friends and I have
a bit of a checkered past.

274
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:45,415
De la marchandise volée à l'Empire galra

275
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,960
Some stolen merchandise
from the Galra Empire

276
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,629
may have fallen into our possession
without us knowing about it.

277
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,674
Well, I'm sure that a full pardon
can be arranged

278
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,179
for the brave souls who bring
Emperor Zarkon a Voltron Lion.

279
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,558
Is that all?

280
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,185
We'll take the reward, too.

281
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,068
Of course.

282
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:18,198
[Rolo]
All right. We're on our way.

283
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,660
[grunts, bones crack]

284
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,912
I almost feel sorry for those
Voltron folks. Seemed like a nice bunch.

285
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,175
If you're feeling guilty,
you can turn yourself in.

286
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,926
Voler à Zarkon
est passible de prison à vie.

287
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,226
Stealing from Zarkon
carries a life sentence.

288
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,979
[Rolo]
They don't seem that nice.

289
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,732
Send the nearest fighter squadron
to the area of the transmission.

290
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,984
I'm not trusting some bounty hunter
with our prize.

291
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,264
[alarm blaring]

292
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,476
No way.

293
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,977
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
There's no way we can outrun those lions.

294
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,744
Not in the open. Good thing
the Zorlar asteroid belt is right up here.

295
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,833
I know that like the back of my hand.

296
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,891
We'll never get through
this asteroid field!

297
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,654
Maybe I can just bust through!

298
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,954
Nope. That was wrong.
That was a bad idea.

299
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,258
Keith, you're the only one
who could possibly fly through this.

300
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,802
We need you, buddy.
Get in there and flush him out.

301
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,474
You got it.
See you on the other side.

302
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,978
[computer beeps]

303
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,398
No way. Get on the blasters.
Take him down!

304
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,900
Copy.

305
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,945
This kid can flat-out fly.

306
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:11,621
-He's gaining on you!
-[grunts]

307
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,209
-Blasters are offline!
-We've got to get out of here!

308
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,962
[all grunting]

309
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,758
[grunts]

310
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,887
[lion growling]

311
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,776
[groans]

312
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,196
Yeah! [chuckles]
Hey, Lance, I got your lion back.

313
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,616
Thank you, Keith.
Now, can you come and unchain me?

314
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,617
What's that? I, uh... You're cutting out.
I can't... I can't hear you.
