1
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,323
[Pidge]
Oh, no!

2
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,825
Please tell me there's not
a giant monster in there.

3
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,328
Please tell me it's empty!
Or full of space candy.

4
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,040
-One of those two. Either one is fine.
-I don't think it's a piÃ±ata, Hunk.

5
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,251
If it's the same kind of the monster
that attacked us on Arus,

6
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,419
we already know how to beat it.

7
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,177
[Shiro]
Hold your ground!

8
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,505
-It's not candy!
-And it's not the same monster!

9
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,510
[Shiro] We need to draw its fire
away from the Balmera's surface!

10
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,264
[all groan]

11
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,494
-We can't hold out!
-My lion is weakening!

12
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,164
If the shield sustains structural damage,
we're done for!

13
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,248
Pidge is right!

14
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,459
Oh, Pidge is right. I'm the one
that said, "We can't hold out!"

15
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,586
Lance, watch your footing!

16
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,090
[all groan]

17
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,634
Okay, Team Voltron, disband!

18
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,847
[Shiro] Everyone, evasive maneuvers!
It can't shoot us all at once!

19
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,185
Okay, it can do that too.

20
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,073
-[both groaning]
-[alarm blaring]

21
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,077
Where does Zarkon get these beasts from?
And how do they keep finding us?

22
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
Princess, the particle barrier
won't sustain much longer.

23
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,000
It's still not at full strength
after the blast from the Galra ship.

24
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,877
Keith, try to draw its fire!

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,421
-I'm coming in from above!
-Roger!

26
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,100
[Lance]
We need to find its blind spot!

27
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,729
I don't think this thing has a blind spot.
It has a thousand eyes.

28
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,733
[Hunk]
Laser eyes. Laser eyes!

29
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,984
[screams]

30
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,156
What do we do? Fighting this thing
is like fighting an entire fleet at once!

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,659
I think we've got to aim
for those laser eyes

32
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,161
-and take them out.
-We'll cover you from up here!

33
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,837
We've lost the spectral generator!
Going to reserve!

34
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,259
There's a fire in VIN bay three!
Suppressors on! Suppressors out!

35
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,594
Princess, the ship is being torn apart!

36
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,430
We're taking heavy fire up here!
We're in trouble!

37
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,517
Princess, pull back!
Get out of its range, now!

38
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,519
We will not abandon you!

39
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,021
You're not abandoning us.
We're about to pull back anyway.

40
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,816
-We are?
-We can't hold out. We have to.

41
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,112
Lions, to the mine shafts! It's the only
place the monster can't get us.

42
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,613
[Pidge]
Roger that!

43
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,532
[Allura]
Heading into orbit!

44
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,922
What is happening?

45
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,842
There's a monster up there
that Zarkon sent to destroy us.

46
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,804
A monster?
Will Zarkon's savagery never abate?

47
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,598
Perhaps our people were
never meant to be free.

48
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,728
Shay, don't give up. Zarkon's power
grows with every planet he conquers,

49
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,522
but he's weakened
by every being that fights back.

50
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,276
Fight back against a monster like that?

51
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,571
-How?
-I don't know, but we can beat it.

52
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,614
-Tell her, Keith.
-Can we?

53
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,410
Yes, we can! This is our first mission
and we're not going to fail.

54
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,122
We can beat it. We just need
some time to come up with a plan.

55
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,875
See? Told you we can.

56
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,877
-Thanks, Shiro.
-[all gasp]

57
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,213
[Balmera moaning]

58
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,009
-Did you guys feel that over there?
-Yeah, we feel it.

59
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,845
It's that sound again. What is that?

60
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,351
[Balmera moaning]

61
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,229
That great noise comes
from the Balmera itself.

62
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,565
Our home crumbles beneath our feet.

63
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,610
The Balmera is dying.

64
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,449
-[Shiro] Coran, Allura, are you there?
-Shiro, we're here.

65
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,034
-The Balmera--
-We already know.

66
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,497
Our scanners are showing
the life energy draining from the Balmera.

67
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,625
How does that happen?

68
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,376
[Coran]
Removing crystals from a Balmera

69
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,588
es como quitar una parte vital
de la bestia poderosa.

70
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,217
is like removing a vital part
of the mighty beast.

71
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,471
The Balmera needs time
to regenerate itself to stay healthy,

72
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,764
but the Galra's greed may have
cost this noble Balmera its life.

73
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,476
So, what's going to happen?

74
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,354
Its core will collapse, destabilizing
the entire skeletal structure.

75
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,856
Anything or anyone remaining
on the Balmera at that point

76
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,361
will be crushed into dust.

77
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,239
-How long before its core collapses?
-Probably a matter of hours.

78
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,991
The mighty organism
willingly gives itself to all,

79
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,995
but not all return its kindness.

80
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,957
Then our time is short.
We'll evacuate the planet.

81
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,959
We need to get all the Balmerans
to the Castle of Lions

82
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,752
before the planet implodes.

83
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,505
Okay, that sounds like a good plan,

84
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,799
but how on earth do you plan
on landing the Castle

85
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,219
with that monster-thingy
on the surface?

86
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,303
-You'll need a distraction.
-We'll engage the beast in our lions.

87
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,515
With it distracted,

88
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,435
Allura and Coran will land the Castle
and load all of its citizens.

89
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,853
Or we could load Balmerans
into our lions a few at a time

90
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,856
and shuttle them to the ship.

91
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,443
Sin pelear con el monstruo láser.
¿Cuánto podemos tardar?

92
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,653
No engaging ferocious laser-eye guy.
How long would that take?

93
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,990
-Days? Weeks?
-We only have hours.

94
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,032
Look, we don't need to beat this thing.

95
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,494
We just need to bait it away
from the ship. Provoke and evade.

96
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,913
Okay, here's the thing.

97
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:41,085
I'm worried that we're going to be really,
really good at the provoking part,

98
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,087
and then really bad at the evading part.

99
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,132
But if this is what it takes to save Shay
and everyone on the planet, then I'm in.

100
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,177
Can you contact the other Balmerans?

101
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,513
I can, but I know not what they'll say.

102
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,765
Leave the planet? Our home?

103
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,852
It's the only option. I'm coming down.

104
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,522
Princess, no! It's too dangerous!

105
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,107
Someone has to be there
to lead these people out.

106
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,235
You're coming down? That thing will
spot your pod and blow it to pieces.

107
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,823
Let me worry about that.

108
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,917
You just focus on keeping
the creature distracted.

109
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,717
[groans]

110
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,512
Okay, we've provoked. Time to evade!

111
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,514
[Shiro] Princess, we've lured
the monster away. It's time.

112
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,356
I'll contact you all
when I'm on the ground.

113
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,568
[Coran]
Be careful out there.

114
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,863
[Lance]
Is that Allura?

115
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,638
We've got to protect the Princess!

116
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,849
[groans]

117
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm on the ground.

118
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,813
[Shiro] Hurry! I don't know how long
we can hold this thing off.

119
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,107
Shay, I'm going to need your help.

120
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,027
Princess?

121
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,824
Have you contacted
the other Balmerans?

122
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,494
What is it? What's going on?

123
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,495
All Balmerans give thanks for the kindness
you and the paladins bestowed upon us,

124
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,416
but, alas, we cannot take leave
of our home.

125
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,752
What?

126
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,212
If our great Balmera's life cycle
is over because of us,

127
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,381
then our desire is to stay with it
until the end.

128
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,092
But you'll never survive.

129
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,847
We contacted the others,
and all agree.

130
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,225
It's not right
that you risk your lives for us.

131
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,937
Please, away. We ask
for no more guilt and shame upon us.

132
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,608
It is our wish.
The wish of all Balmerans.

133
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,444
No. I won't give up on you.

134
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,864
I won't give up on any of you,
no matter the circumstances.

135
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,035
But we do not ask this of you. Please!

136
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,163
I have heard your words.
Now, let me speak mine.

137
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,417
I want to talk to the Balmerans.
Can you get a message to them from me?

138
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,379
There is no need to speak for you.

139
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,757
You have a unique power within.

140
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:39,639
The Balmera will carry your words.

141
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:50,441
[gasps]

142
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,986
Speak your heart, child.
All can hear you.

143
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,241
Balmerans, this is Princess Allura.
You don't know me, but I am here to help.

144
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,871
I know what it's like
to watch your home planet die.

145
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,540
For I come from planet Altea, a planet
that has long been destroyed by the Galra.

146
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,919
But I refused to give up.
And now, you all have the same choice.

147
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,381
You can decide now to devote your lives

148
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,051
to making sure this never happens
to another planet.

149
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,262
I am eternally sorry
for what has happened to the Balmera,

150
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,516
but I beg you,
do not let its dying be in vain.

151
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,814
Honor the Balmera's death
by refusing to give up.

152
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,358
Join me in my fight against the Galra.

153
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,819
Your words have touched our hearts.

154
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,364
Thank you.

155
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,743
No, thank you.

156
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,956
You've given us reason to hope again.

157
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,125
Everyone, head to the caves
just under the surface.

158
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,543
Princess, your speech must have worked.

159
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,552
The Balmerans are moving
toward the surface!

160
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,721
[all panting]

161
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,722
Coran, we're just beneath the surface.

162
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,975
Triangulate my position.
This is your landing zone.

163
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,770
[all groan]

164
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,318
Yes, Allura. Readying ship.

165
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,946
Castle of Lions, coming in!
Paladins, how are you holding up?

166
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,032
I think we've got him pretty distracted.
Are the Balmerans in position?

167
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,121
[Allura]
They're making their way to the top.

168
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:54,064
[Balmerans panting]

169
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,529
[both gasp]

170
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,199
-Bring them out! Hurry, now!
-[rumbling]

171
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,910
[Balmerans screaming]

172
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,752
No!

173
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,129
[Balmerans screaming]

174
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,798
It's on the verge of collapsing!
We have to go!

175
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,767
-But the Balmerans!
-They're trapped!

176
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,354
-What can be done? Time is short!
-[rumbling]

177
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,940
Every hit weakens the Balmera.
Have you evacuated yet? What's happening?

178
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,691
[Coran] The Balmerans are trapped.
Just keep distracting that beast!

179
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,528
Uh, do you want us
to distract it by dying?

180
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,072
Because that's what's going to happen!

181
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:49,119
Guys, remember when I said
we didn't have to beat it?

182
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
-Yes, I remember that.
-We might have to beat it.

183
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,998
We're lost! All are trapped
with no chance for escape!

184
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,752
We can't give up.

185
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,631
But what can be done?

186
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,051
The Balmera!

187
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,427
The ground beneath your mighty ship
appears healed.

188
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,807
Its essence thrives. But how?

189
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,602
The Castle!

190
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,021
Not just the Castle, but you, as well.

191
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,110
It's true. Your Altean energy
combined with the ship's crystal

192
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,113
has revitalized this part of the Balmera.

193
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:29,034
That's it! Maybe we can perform
the ceremony you spoke about.

194
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,288
-We can save the Balmera.
-What ceremony?

195
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,166
In the days of old, when Alteans were
given the gift of crystals from a Balmera,

196
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,169
we would repay its sacrifice
by performing a ceremony.

197
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,215
A sacred Altean would re-infuse
the Balmera with quintessence.

198
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,384
In this way, we had
a symbiotic relationship.

199
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,513
The Galra have only been taking.

200
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,932
It's time we give back.

201
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,144
I can connect
with the crystal in the bridge

202
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,228
and use the Castle's power
as an amplifier.

203
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,773
When your father performed the ceremony,
it was on a much smaller scale.

204
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,984
I beg you.

205
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,239
To heal an entire planet, it could take
more energy than you possess.

206
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,185
Quizá no sobreviva.

207
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,633
You may not live through it.

208
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,802
I know you're scared for me, Coran,
but I must try.

209
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,596
[gasps]

210
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,102
Guys, this isn't working. We'll never
take this beast down in our lions.

211
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,606
Well, forming Voltron didn't work, either.

212
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,777
Not without some way to shoot
all those laser eyes at once.

213
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,070
That's weird.
What are you trying to tell me?

214
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,365
Guys! Guys, something's happening here!

215
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,077
I-I think there's a way to take down
all those laser eyes at once.

216
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,748
[Pidge]
Well, what is it?

217
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,961
Do you remember how Voltron
formed that sword with Keith's bayard?

218
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,463
I think my lion's telling me
I can do the same thing with my bayard.

219
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,091
-[Keith] Are you sure?
-Let's find out. Form thingy!

220
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,181
-It didn't work!
-Because we didn't form Voltron yet.

221
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:05,691
Oh, right. Yeah, I know.

222
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,654
Guys, whatever we're planning,
let's hurry up and do it.

223
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,229
[growls]

224
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,187
We've got to defend the Castle!
Everyone, follow me. Form Voltron!

225
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,855
[roars]

226
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,357
[roars]

227
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,067
[grunting]

228
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,239
[both grunting]

229
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,744
[grunting]

230
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,090
It's not enough!

231
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,676
We'll have to try something else!

232
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,387
[groans]

233
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,086
[computer beeping]

234
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,109
-Are you guys seeing this?
-Roger that.

235
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,491
Let's see what this thing can do.
Engage!

236
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,329
Guys, look!

237
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,164
[snarls]

238
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,335
[sighs, groans]

239
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:58,840
Princess, are you all right?

240
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,968
[groaning]

241
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,552
Did it work?

242
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,559
Yes. The Balmera lives. It thanks you.

243
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,870
[paladins panting]

244
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,420
[all gasp]

245
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,798
No!

246
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,093
[snarling]

247
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,690
[Hunk]
No way.

248
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,901
The Balmera just saved us.

249
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,487
Look at the crystals!

250
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,159
Oh, who's a good Balmera? You are.
Who ate the big monster? You did.

251
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,243
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

252
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,758
Dude, what are you doing?

253
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,093
What? It's alive,
and it wuvs my scwatches.

254
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,596
[chuckles]

255
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,978
Thank you for honoring
your vow to return.

256
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,523
I should be thanking you.

257
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,360
You made me understand
what's most important.

258
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,033
Zarkon and his Galra Empire
are destroying lives.

259
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,034
I'm a part of a team that can change that.
I know that, now.
