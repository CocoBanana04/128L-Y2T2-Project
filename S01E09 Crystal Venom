1
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,979
[Allura sighs]

2
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,983
I loved the smell of the mountain
juniberries in the early morning breeze.

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,277
[Alfor]
As did I, Allura.

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,529
Remember the summer berry festival?

5
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,492
People would come from all over Altea
for the harvest.

6
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,787
I remember how the berry juice
stained your favorite dress.

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,163
You were so upset.

8
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,082
[laughs]

9
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,584
It took forever for Mother to calm me.

10
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,756
I miss Altea so much.
I miss you, Father.

11
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,468
-I wish it didn't have to be this way.
-I know, Allura,

12
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,222
but, as leaders, we have to do
what's right for our people,

13
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,600
even if it means great sacrifice.

14
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,937
I know, Father.
That's what you always say.

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,273
Princess, there you are.
What are you doing up and about?

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,483
You should be resting.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,985
Oh, Coran, can't I stay?

18
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,072
The Balmera rejuvenation ceremony
took a lot out of you.

19
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,573
Come along, to your room.

20
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,994
Get your rest, darling.
I will be here for you when you're well.

21
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,373
I love you, Father. I'll see you soon.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,094
[Coran] Pidge, please come down
to the detainment room.

23
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,345
[groans]

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,859
[electronic beeping]

25
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,612
Okay, guys,
Sendak's almost all hooked up.

26
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,406
aunque esta tecnología se usa
para mantener los recuerdos,

27
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,117
But, look, I have to warn you,

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,077
this technology was used
to keep Altean memories alive,

29
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,539
not to interrogate prisoners.

30
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,749
Coran, we understand this isn't
what the technology was meant for,

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,878
but if we can extract Sendak's memories,

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,964
we may gain valuable intelligence
on Zarkon's troop locations.

33
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,258
Yeah, and then we can just be like,
"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,845
"The avenging fury of Voltron, son!"

35
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,430
Fascinating.
So, how exactly does this work?

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,642
As the memories are extracted,

37
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,605
they're written bit by bit on individual
molecules of the micro-storage strands.

38
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,317
When I go, I want all the stuff
in my brain stored in a giant ship.

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,737
-Das passt doch auf einen Papierflieger.
-Ach ja?

40
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,030
The amount of information in your brain
could be stored in a paper airplane.

41
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,451
Oh, yeah? Well, the amount of information
you have, Keith, could be...

42
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,496
Yeah?

43
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,500
-Uh... it's less than what I have!
-Oh, good one, Lance!

44
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,968
This is how you incorporated King Alfor's
memories into the Castle of Lions?

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,054
Precisely, but it's never been attempted
before on an unwilling participant.

46
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,482
Uh, is this what's supposed
to be happening?

47
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,401
Let's give it some time.

48
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
[sighs]

49
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:02,742
[snoring]

50
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,288
[groans]

51
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,250
Well, I can't wait around anymore.
I'm going to hit the training deck.

52
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,172
Okay, if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the lab.

53
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,675
Maybe I can pull some information
from Sendak's Galra crystal.

54
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,636
Time to feed the beast.
I'm going to go make some breakfast.

55
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,138
Well, I'm afraid I can't wait here
any longer, either.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,516
I have a million duties to attend to.
Between that Galra crystal

57
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,602
infecting our system,
and then fighting off those ships

58
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,480
and performing the Balmeran
rejuvenation ceremony,

59
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:38,027
the old Castle of Lions
has taken quite a beating.

60
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,864
Every system needs to be
recharged and repaired.

61
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,951
I'll stay. Somewhere in Sendak's mind is
the information about Zarkon that we need.

62
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,954
Okay, well, while you guys do that,
I think I'm gonna get my chill on.

63
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,372
Maybe kick back with a lemonade
or space juice. Something.

64
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,957
Hold on there, space juice.
You're going to come and help me.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,834
What? Why? Why me?

66
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,169
Because you're the last one here

67
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,256
and because your activity
isn't very important.

68
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,882
Wait, did I say
"chill with a good lemonade"?

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,552
-I meant I gotta do homework.
-No. Too late.

70
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,137
Fine.

71
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,555
Let us know if anything happens.

72
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,147
Shiro?

73
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,402
You got it.

74
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,571
Maybe today,
we try a little crème goo-lée.

75
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,116
Hmm? [grunting]

76
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,118
[groans]

77
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,579
[moaning]

78
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,208
[screams]
My eye!

79
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,170
[screams]

80
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,006
[gasps]
What is going on in here?

81
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,014
The goo has me pinned down!
[groans]

82
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,558
[growls]

83
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,061
Okay, we're going to have
to flank the goo to shut it down.

84
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,187
Okay, wait. Wait!

85
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,197
It's been a pleasure cooking with you.

86
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,784
Go!

87
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,995
[grunting]

88
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,041
[both whimper]

89
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,920
Probably a malfunction?

90
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,839
Yeah, yeah. Guess the kitchen system
needs to be rebooted, too.

91
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,007
Leave it for Coran?

92
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,677
[whistling]

93
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,221
[Lance groans]

94
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,723
Since when did "you sleep in it,
you clean it" become a Voltron rule?

95
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,017
Also, how is it these pods

96
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,104
have the ability to heal
a human from near death,

97
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,732
but don't have the ability
to clean themselves?

98
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,527
[laughs] Self-cleaning pods.
Now, that's a good one!

99
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,612
This kind of reminds me
of my time as a young cadet.

100
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,614
I had just enlisted
in the Altean space squad

101
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,283
aeronautics sub-tech
nano-weaponry unit,

102
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,495
and I was sent off to boot camp.

103
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,288
Our sergeant had us cleaning
cryo-pods day and night.

104
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,499
I got so good at it,
I earned my first set of stripes!

105
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,292
[screams]
Coran! Hey!

106
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,920
-Oh, those were the days.
-[muffled screaming] Hey!

107
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,091
Anyway, you keep up the good work

108
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,051
and maybe someday you'll earn
some cleaning stripes, too.

109
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,183
Lance? Lance!

110
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,937
Ah, paladins...

111
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,161
[grunts]

112
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,330
[sighs]
Start training level three.

113
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,999
[groans]

114
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,378
[panting]

115
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,672
End training sequence.

116
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,063
End training sequence!

117
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,950
End training sequence now!

118
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,494
[panting]

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,915
I know you're in there, Sendak.
I know you have all the answers.

120
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,168
Give them to me.

121
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,216
[grunts]

122
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,597
You're a broken soldier!
You can't hold out forever!

123
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,850
So, you can hear me.

124
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,353
[screams]

125
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,772
[whimpering]

126
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,442
This pod just shut on me
and locked me in,

127
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,945
while you were rambling on
about boot camp!

128
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,947
You sure you didn't just trip and fall in?
No judgment. It happens.

129
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,114
Besides, why would the pod
automatically lock and start

130
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,785
the cryogenic freezing process?

131
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,539
To kill me!

132
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,917
Don't get your boots in a bunch.
My guess is they're malfunctioning.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,795
Okay, I'm gonna float this out there.
I think this castle is haunted.

134
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,172
The ship might seem like a fantastical,
magical creature to you,

135
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,801
but it's really just a big embodiment
of advanced supernatural technology

136
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,388
that cannot be explained by science alone.

137
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,599
Well, that does make it seem
a bit haunted, doesn't it?

138
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,019
But it's not. Trust me, nothing out
of the ordinary is happening here.

139
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,312
-[whimpering]
-[faint rumbling]

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,481
I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

141
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,778
[whimpering]

142
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,864
[screaming]

143
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,659
[Alfor]
Allura?

144
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,579
-Allura?
-[squeaking]

145
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,249
[moaning]

146
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,128
Allura, dear daughter...

147
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,136
Father, what are you doing here?

148
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,972
Huh?

149
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,266
Okay, okay.

150
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,060
[whimpering]

151
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,147
Coran, is that you?

152
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,773
Okay, stop messing with me, guys.
This isn't funny.

153
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,402
[Coran]
Help! Help!

154
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,404
Hello? Coran?

155
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,864
Help! Somebody!

156
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,284
[voice becomes distorted]
I'm trapped in the airlock.

157
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,749
I'm coming!

158
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,084
[panting]
Huh?

159
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,961
Okay, ha-ha. Good joke.
You guys got me. Nice.

160
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,424
[computer]
Airlock opening in 30 ticks.

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,512
Okay, joke's over! You got me!

162
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,807
-...29, 28, 27...
-Guys? Guys! Help!

163
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,685
[Shiro] What was the first rank
you held in Zarkon's army?

164
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,606
Where did you find the Red Lion?

165
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,030
What is Zarkon's greatest weakness?

166
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,662
[Sendak's voice] What makes you think
you can possibly defeat him?

167
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,293
If you were to attack Zarkon,
where would you strike?

168
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,342
Why strike at all
when you can join him?

169
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,095
[gasps]

170
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,805
[Pidge] I bet if we can modulate
the dynamics of this crystal,

171
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,848
we'll be able to reverse engineer
a lot of Galra tech.

172
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,850
Glaubst du nicht, Hunk?

173
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,229
Don't you think, Hunk?

174
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,816
Hunk, are you paying attention?

175
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,735
What? No, I'm sorry.

176
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,404
That whole food goo ambush
really set me on edge, Pidge.

177
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,408
If we can't trust food,
we are lost as a culture.

178
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,828
Relax. I'm sure the Castle's just glitchy.

179
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,039
It's 10,000 years old.

180
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,835
Yeah, it does seem like the ship
is not currently trying to kill us.

181
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:55,714
Okay, so, all the sensors are
on the crystal. Hit the switch.

182
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,635
[moaning]

183
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,220
Hunk, did you accidentally hit
the anti-gravity switch?

184
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,014
Uh, no. There's no anti-gravity switch.
Uh, is there?

185
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,267
[grunting]

186
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,855
Curse my short arms!

187
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,732
Oh, I hate those little things!
All right, forget it, Pidge.

188
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,653
I'm going to swim toward you.
Just hang on!

189
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:21,574
[grunting]

190
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,202
-That's it. I'm all out of moves.
-[stomach rumbles]

191
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh, I'm hungry again. I hope some food goo
comes oozing out of these walls.

192
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,083
-[muffled] Help! Help! Help!
-...twelve, eleven, ten...

193
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,545
...nine, eight, seven...

194
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,465
-[muffled] Keith!
-...six, five...

195
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,425
-What are you doing in there?
-[yells]

196
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,968
I need help! Because if you don't
get me out of here right now,

197
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,182
-I'm going to be sucked out into space!
-Doors opening.

198
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,517
I'm getting sucked out into space!

199
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,107
[screaming]

200
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,361
[screaming continues]

201
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,781
[grunting]

202
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,116
[screaming continues]

203
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,036
Keith! Keith, come on!

204
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,705
[both panting]

205
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,875
[both sigh]

206
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,127
What were you doing out there?

207
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,091
-Who was that guy?
-He was trying to kill me!

208
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,762
Well, is he the Castle?
Because that's who's trying to kill me!

209
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:30,059
[both gasp, scream]

210
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,437
Altean flowers are the most beautiful.

211
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,065
It is sad that I will only
see them in my dreams.

212
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,984
But, when I wake, my memories are
like these spores, scattered in the wind.

213
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,819
Altea is not merely a dream, Allura.

214
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,616
It still exists.

215
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,243
The Altean flower, you can see it.

216
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:53,290
You can touch it.

217
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,878
I can take you there.
I can take you home.

218
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,550
You can?

219
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,387
-Would you like to go home?
-Yes. I want to go back to Altea, Father.

220
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,639
Then come with me,
and I will show you the way.

221
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:13,060
[squeaking]

222
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,979


223
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:19,525
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I have an idea. Grab on!

224
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,944
[both grunting]

225
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,866
-Yeah! We did it! Now, what?
-Now, kick me as hard as you can!

226
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,325
What? No, we're friends.

227
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,578
No, no. Kick me so I can fly across
the room and get to the control panel.

228
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,288
[both grunt]

229
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,334
Oh... oh, oh!

230
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,630
No, no, no!

231
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,175
[grunts, groans]

232
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,888
[screams]

233
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,515
How can you guys be taking a nap
while this castle is trying to kill us?

234
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
Taking a nap? We've been floating around
in Zero G! You know how scary that is?

235
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:58,314
That's not scary! That's fun!
I was almost ejected into space!

236
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,525
I got attacked by killer food, and that's
the most horrifying thing you can imagine!

237
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,235
The stuff of nightmares!
It'll haunt me to my grave!

238
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,071
Well, I had a robot trying to kill me!

239
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,783
I don't care what you say, Coran.
This castle has gone apples and bananas!

240
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,913
[groans] Perhaps the infection
from Sendak's Galra crystal

241
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,751
is worse than we thought.

242
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,671
-Well, let's get rid of it.
-It's too late.

243
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,299
When Sendak plugged it into the ship,
it corrupted the entire system.

244
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:30,554
Sendak? Wait. Has anyone seen Shiro?

245
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,223
[Sendak's voice]
We're connected, you and me.

246
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,645
Both part of the Galra Empire.

247
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:43,067
No! I'm not like you.

248
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,862
You've been broken and reformed.
Just look at your hand.

249
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,573
That's not me!

250
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,241
It's the strongest part of you.
Embrace it.

251
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:56,413
The others don't know what you know.
They haven't seen what you've seen.

252
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,623
Face it. You'll never beat Zarkon.

253
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,376
He's already defeated you.

254
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,674
I'm not listening to you!

255
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,392
Do you really think a monster like you
could be a Voltron Paladin?

256
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,727
Stop it!

257
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,812
[panting]

258
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,022
-[screams]
-[alarm blaring]

259
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,442
I remember how you used to dance
around this very ballroom.

260
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,748
I can still hear you giggling.

261
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,210
Oh...

262
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,588
Those were happy memories.

263
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,384
We can create new memories, Allura.

264
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,846
[Pidge]
Shiro, are you okay?

265
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,932
-[Keith] Where's Sendak?
-I... I had to get him out of here.

266
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,185
I was hearing his voice.
He... He can't be trusted on this ship.

267
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,521
It is the ship! I got stuck in a cryo-pod,
then, in an airlock.

268
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,780
Keith got attacked by a robot,
and Hunk and Pidge got attacked by food.

269
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,826
-It's been a weird morning.
-[computer beeping]

270
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,203
�

271
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,957
-What? How is that possible?
-What is it?

272
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
The ship is starting a wormhole jump!

273
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,172
Allura, what's going on?

274
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,548
We're going to Altea.
We're going home.

275
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,932
My father is taking us.

276
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,776
Stay away from my daughter!

277
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,197
-[Hunk] Uh...
-Allura, wake up!

278
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,917
The crystal must have corrupted
King Alfor's artificial intelligence.

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,711
It's taking over!

280
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,380
We're headed straight for a star
and it's about to explode!

281
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:16,095
Father, I can see Altea.

282
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,807
Allura! Allura, wake up!
What you're seeing isn't real.

283
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,851
The juniberries,
the most exquisite flower of all.

284
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,693
Allura, please!
You've got to listen to me!

285
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,822
Is this real?

286
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,783
Of course it is real, Daughter.
That flower you're touching is real.

287
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,159
[Coran] But where is the fragrance
of the sweet juniberries?

288
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,453
[sniffs]
Huh?

289
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,581
That's not Altea.

290
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,084
When that star goes supernova,
it will destroy the entire system.

291
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,295
Allura, you must reset the course
and get us out of here!

292
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,381
[panting]

293
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:57,386
[screams]

294
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,389
Father, please, I beg you
to turn this ship around.

295
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,641
If we don't do it soon,
we will all perish!

296
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,812
I know. That is my intention.

297
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,731
What? Why?

298
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,235
Don't you see, dear daughter?
Zarkon can never be defeated.

299
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,656
He's been ruling for ten thousand years.

300
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,076
But we must continue to fight!

301
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,330
Fight for what? It is all over for Altea.

302
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:31,128
You don't have to live a lifetime of war.

303
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,464
You can be with me
and the rest of your people.

304
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,801
Father, please! The paladins and I
can still stop Zarkon!

305
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,471
Somewhere in there,
you must want that to happen.

306
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,224
Allura, my A.I. has been corrupted.
You must disconnect my power source.

307
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,102
We can stroll across the Blossom Canyon
every morning, just like we used to.

308
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:53,233
Remember how much you loved that?

309
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,778
I remember. I'll see you soon, Father.

310
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,626
I've got to get into the A.I. chamber

311
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
to disconnect my father's
power source manually.

312
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,213
But that means losing King Alfor forever!

313
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,549
Paladins, get to your lions! I need you to
slow the Castle's descent into the star.

314
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,678
I can try to override the system
to open the hangars.

315
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,722
[panting]

316
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,563
Don't do this!

317
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,864
You must.

318
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,200
All my memories,
all my knowledge will be lost forever!

319
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,912
Do it, Allura. If you are to live,
we must say goodbye.

320
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,331
I'm sorry about this, Father.

321
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,333
[gasps]

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,295
[Alfor laughing]

323
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,758
-Huh?
-[Alfor's voice] Oh, my dear daughter...

324
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,260
[Allura and Alfor laughing]

325
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,137
[Allura giggling]

326
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,723
[Young Allura]
Father...

327
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,934
This is not real.
This is all in the past.

328
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,852
[grunts]

329
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,647
[Allura laughing]

330
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,234
-[gasps]
-[baby cooing]

331
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,696
[cooing continues]

332
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,075
[baby laughing]

333
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,996
[moans]

334
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,892
You don't have to fight, Allura.

335
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,312
You don't have to make this sacrifice.

336
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,069
[both grunt]

337
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,515
Goodbye, Father.

338
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,309
Goodbye, Allura.

339
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,354
She did it.
