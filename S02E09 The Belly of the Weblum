1
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,689
[snoring]

2
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,153
[gasps]

3
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,364
[resumes snoring]

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,532
What? What'd I miss?

5
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,119
Oh, nothing important. We've just
figured out a way to defeat Zarkon.

6
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,080
Really? I dozed for ten minutes,

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,499
and you guys figured out
how to defeat the forces of evil?

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,584
You've been asleep for three hours.

9
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,591
I think we've got something here.

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,636
It's dangerous
and there are a lot of moving parts,

11
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,180
but if we can coordinate
everything just right, then--

12
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,557
Zarkon's reign will be at an end,

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,353
and the savagery that's poisoned
our universe can finally be cleansed.

14
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,106
-You've done it, Shiro.
-We did it together.

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,072
As long as we all stick to the plan,
it should work.

16
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:59,828
It will work. Perhaps, then, you'll learn
that not all Galra are as bad as Zarkon.

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,207
I hope not.

18
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,254
[Antok]
Ulaz was right to trust you all.

19
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,840
He sacrificed everything
to bring us together.

20
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,509
Let's honor him
by taking down Zarkon.

21
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,847
-[Hunk] So, what's the plan?
-The plan is amazing!

22
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,808
First, we infect Zarkon's ship
with a virus.

23
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,396
Then, we make an extra-large wormhole
and lure Zarkon inside of it,

24
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,731
zapping him a bajillion light-years away.

25
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:34,821
Then, when he pops out on the other side,
all like, "Oh, why doesn't my ship work?"

26
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,489
Voltron kicks his butt!

27
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,909
Pew, pew, pew!
Womp, womp, womp! Huh! Hi-yah!

28
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,286
[deep voice]
"I'll form the head!"

29
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,996
[normal voice]
That's what you say, Shiro.

30
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,083
Yeah, yeah. Yeah! We won for all time!

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,336
Wow. So, this is it.

32
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,055
I guess the only question is,
when do we strike?

33
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,977
As soon as we build a teludav
big enough to wormhole Zarkon's ship.

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,397
Oh, man. The teludav again?
Does that mean we need more scaultrite?

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,066
That's just one
of the many things we'll need.

36
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,653
Am I, uh... Am I sensing a trip
back to the space mall here?

37
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,405
[Coran]
I'm afraid not.

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,242
This is gonna take a lot more scaultrite
than we can find in any Unilu shop.

39
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,705
For this plan to succeed, we're gonna need
to split up. We all have a task to do.

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,250
Keith, Hunk, you'll be in charge
of getting the scaultrite.

41
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,879
If any one of us fails,
the entire plan fails.

42
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,652
[mouse squeaking]

43
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,031
So, how about a kiss for good luck?

44
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,658
[smacking lips, moaning]

45
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,333
[muffled scream]

46
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,636
Don't worry, we'll see each other soon.

47
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,097
Take care, Coran.

48
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,141
Stay safe, Princess.

49
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,806
[grunts]

50
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,518
Did you sense the lion?

51
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,521
[groans]
Nothing.

52
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:19,610
-It is wise that you rest.
-I will find that lion.

53
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,156
Begin the process again.

54
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,209
[Hunk] Why does Allura get to take
a leisurely visit to the Balmera

55
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,255
while we have to fly into the belly
of a giant space worm to get scaultrite?

56
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,425
You heard Coran.
Building a huge teludav isn't easy.

57
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,594
Everyone has a job to do
and this is ours.

58
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,054
But I always get the worst jobs.

59
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,723
Go to a Galra-occupied planet
to get my lion.

60
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,933
Go to a Galra-occupied Balmera
to get a crystal.

61
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,936
Go into a belly of a beast
with the only Galra alien team member.

62
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,021
I'm not an alien.

63
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,566
Well, you're kind of an alien.
You're way more alien than me.

64
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,777
You're at least some alien.
I'm-I'm none alien.

65
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,654
[sighs]
Let's just concentrate on the job here.

66
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,494
Yeah. Was-Was your mom the alien?
Your grandpa? How Galra are you?

67
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,661
I don't know.

68
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,332
Did the Blade of Marmora, like, teach you
the secret handshake, or something?

69
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,335
No. No one said anything.

70
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,797
The Blade of Marmora...
They're real tight-lipped, aren't they?

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,591
I get that your society is secret,
but is everything a secret?

72
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:28,262
Okay, look, it's bad enough that Allura
hates me now. Can you just lay off?

73
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,223
Allura doesn't hate you.

74
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,226
You just need to give her time
to accept the fact that you're Galra,

75
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,020
the race that destroyed her entire planet
and all of her people.

76
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,397
Yeah, she might hate you a little bit.

77
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,026
Let's just watch the video
Coran uploaded and stay on task.

78
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,070
We need to find out
how to collect this stuff.

79
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,575
Hello, brave Altean.

80
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,079
No way. Is that Coran?

81
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,499
So, you're about to go into the belly
of a weblum to harvest scaultrite.

82
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,084
Good for you!

83
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,919
Scaultrite is an important substance,

84
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,880
with thousands of commercial
and industrial uses,

85
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,258
including fabrication foam,

86
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,677
insect night vision goggles, teludav--

87
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,596
Uh...

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,850
...anti-fungal klanmÃ¼irl lotion
and other such lubricants.

89
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,643
What's wrong with the video?

90
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,020
It's ten thousand years old.
It's probably corroded.

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,108
I could go on for days.

92
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,028
But you've got a weblum to enter
and some scaultrite to collect.

93
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,532
Oh, look! There's a weblum now.
Hello, big fella!

94
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,662
Hey, Coran! I'm off to eat some planets.
There's one now!

95
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,290
-Nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum!
-We'll see you soon!

96
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,751
As you probably remember from school,
the weblum is an enormous creature

97
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,754
and an integral part
of keeping our universe functioning.

98
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,465
It survives off of the--

99
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,008
...left over from dead planets.

100
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,344
It then reconverts
the quintessence remnants by--

101
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,181
...becoming the building blocks
of new solar systems.

102
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,765
Incredible, isn't it?

103
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,226
[both whimpering nervously]

104
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,188
Of course, these are no gentle giants.

105
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,565
They're actually giants
that are quite deadly,

106
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,775
which leads to rule number one.

107
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,111
It's an important one, so listen closely.

108
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,113
Stay away from its--

109
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,157
-You got that?
-No. No, I didn't.

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,701
It's like a rhyme. Say it with me.

111
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,329


112
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,663
Stay away from its--

113
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,209
Oh, come on!

114
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,877
Other things to remember
include avoiding the poisonous--

115
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,462
...eye sockets--

116
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,008
...could lead to certain death!

117
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,846
Whoa. What are those?

118
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,390
[Keith]
They look like... dead planets.

119
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,810
That's strange.

120
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,064
The charts I'm looking at show
these planets should still be thriving.

121
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,983
Wow. What do you think happened
to them? Asteroid strike?

122
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,027
Something tells me
they died an unnatural death.

123
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,158
[Hunk]
Look!

124
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,661
[Keith] Guess that ancient Altean
weblum tracker put us right on the money.

125
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,038
We gotta get out of here!
We haven't watched the entire video yet!

126
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,083
-We don't know what to do!
-We're not leaving.

127
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,753
You fly, keep our distance.
I'll skim through the video.

128
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,463
So, you've made it
into the weblum's first stomach!

129
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,716
-[Hunk] Rewind!
-[Keith] I know!

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,093
[Coran]
So, you've identified a weblum. Great!

131
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,762
Now, remember rule number one.

132
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,305
Stay away from its face.

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,057
[Hunk]
Wait, that's rule number one?

134
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,812
We broke rule number one!

135
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,022
[Hunk]
Oh, no! What's it doing?

136
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,112
Get us out of the way, now!

137
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,217
[grunting]

138
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,428
The weblum's natural defense--
venomous laser, deadly acid--

139
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,640
total annihilation--
death monster--

140
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:04,895
...to find its blind spot on the back
of its neck, just below the gills.

141
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,522
That's your way inside!
If I can't see ya, I can't kill ya!

142
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,616
-[rapid beeping]
-[grunts]

143
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,163
This isn't good. This isn't good!

144
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,382
[both grunting]

145
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,134
We're attached to its back,
in its blind spot.

146
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,928
Good. We're going in.

147
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,723
Wait, what do we do
when we're inside the beast?

148
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,892
A quick recap of what to do
when you're inside the beast.

149
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,395
One, avoid things that want to kill you.

150
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,106
Two, get to the third stomach
and find the scaultrite gland.

151
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,525
Three, activate the weblum's
defense mechanisms

152
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,194
and collect the excess material
from the gland.

153
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,781
That's the scaultrite!

154
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,824
-Seems simple enough.
-Seems under-explained.

155
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,497
-Come on.
-[sighs]

156
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,424
[grunts, groans]

157
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,343
[grunting]

158
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,693
[Hunk]
Got it, got it.

159
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,489
Why are you tampering with evidence?

160
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,533
Commander Thace, I was ordered
to assist you in your investigation

161
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,451
into the possible traitors on board.

162
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,120
Ordered by whom?

163
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,455
Haggar.

164
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,707
I've analyzed the sentry
that was destroyed

165
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,379
just before the shields went down.

166
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,299
The one that was killed by Prorok.
I've already examined him.

167
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,929
So, you found the trace elements
of luxite on the wound?

168
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,765
It's a very rare metal.

169
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,184
If we find others on the ship
in possession of luxite,

170
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,103
we will have found our traitors.

171
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,147
Then what are you waiting for?

172
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,732
Begin the search
starting with the lower block.

173
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,824
I'll assign some sentries to that.

174
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,661
Is there anything else?

175
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,164
As chief investigator,
your life could be in danger.

176
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,834
I have been given orders
to remain by your side

177
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,301
until we clear all personnel
or find the spy.

178
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,596
[grunts]
Uh, yuck!

179
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,723
What am I standing on?
A mucus pocket? I do not like mucus!

180
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,225
And is that steaming stomach acid?
Lookit, right over there.

181
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,313
Oh, man, I really hope
I don't see any blood.

182
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,774
Hunk! Knock it off.
You're freaking yourself out.

183
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,401
No, standing inches away
from a pus-bubble is freaking me out.

184
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,530
[groaning]

185
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,241
Look, we're inside a disgusting worm.
There's no way to sugarcoat it.

186
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,744
We're gonna need that big brain of yours
if we want to make it through.

187
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,580
-Will you be all right?
-[continues groaning]

188
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,706
I said, will you be all right?

189
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,292
Uh...

190
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,835
Okay, okay.
[inhales deeply]

191
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,631
I'll be okay.

192
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,801
Good. I gotta be able to count on you.

193
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,722
Besides, no one knows
an explosive digestive tract like you.

194
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,226
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you just make a joke?

195
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,062
[chuckles]
Seriously, that was a joke, wasn't it?

196
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,647
You're saying I throw up a lot.
I get it. It's funny.

197
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,731
[laughing]

198
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,402
I do.

199
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,864
Wow. Galra Keith is way funnier
than regular Keith.

200
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,782
[Keith] Okay, we need to find a way
around the stomach acid.

201
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,453
[Hunk] Huh?

202
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,165
-What are these things?
-Uh... Uh...

203
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,876
I don't know. Maybe they're bacteria?

204
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,170
-Uh... Oh...
-[creatures squeaking]

205
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,256
Wait, wait, wait. They seem friendly.

206
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,346
They seem friendly.
Maybe they're good bacteria.

207
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,100
They like me. They're--
[chuckles] They're tickling me.

208
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,477
Wait, that's not tickling!
That's hot acid!

209
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,897
[screams] They want to kill us!
They want to kill us!

210
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,567
I think they're part
of the creature's digestive system!

211
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,950
They're trying to break down the food
and we're the food!

212
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,702
[groaning]
I can't see anything!

213
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,120
[groans, grunts]

214
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,955
[grunting]

215
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,042
Hunk!

216
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm here, surrounded by blood.
I hate blood!

217
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,516
[Keith] You've gotta find a way out
of the circulatory system.

218
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,984
Hunk! I'm outnumbered here!
Meet me in the third stomach!

219
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,907
Gotta get out of this acid.

220
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,533
[screaming]

221
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,659
[grunting]

222
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,746
Huh?

223
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,167
[grunting]

224
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,545
[breathing heavily]

225
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,839
What the--?

226
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,427
Impossible.

227
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,345
[screams]
I don't like blood-slides!

228
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,388
[grunts]

229
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,474
[grunting]

230
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,022
Oh, no.

231
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
Don't move. I'm here to help.

232
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,535
Huh?

233
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,205
[grunting]

234
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,125
[weapon whirring]

235
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,714
-You're Galra.
-[creatures squeaking]

236
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,967
Not those things again.

237
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,510
What are you doing?

238
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,221
[alarm blaring]

239
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,646
 

240
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,022
You're turning this ship into a bomb.

241
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,944
[grunts]

242
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,028
[grunting]

243
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,239
[grunting]

244
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,992
[loud rumbling]

245
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,618
Keith! Keith, are you there?

246
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,453
Keith, answer me!

247
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,038
[grunting]

248
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,125
[grunting, yelling]

249
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,335
-[groaning]
-[running footsteps approaching]

250
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,844
[gasps, grunts]

251
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,853
[weapon whirring]

252
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,230
I guess you can keep your weapon.

253
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,982
[groaning, grunting]

254
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,860
[sighs]

255
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,280
[groans]

256
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:19,079
-Oh, my gosh, I found it!
-[stomach grumbling]

257
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:24,334
Oh, my gosh, don't throw up.
Don't throw-- [retches]

258
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,837
Keith! Keith, you made it!
We both made it! Who is this?

259
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,090
Someone I found.
He doesn't talk much. Also, he's Galra.

260
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,426
What, do you guys all know
each other? [chuckles]

261
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,387
Are you sure we should be rescuing
a Galra soldier right now?

262
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,432
We're Paladins of Voltron.

263
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,101
We can't just leave people to die,
even if they are Galra.

264
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,605
Now, come on. Let's get
what we came for and get out.

265
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,065
Okay, well, that--
that might be a problem, too.

266
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,485
The scaultrite gland somehow secretes
mucus, or saliva, or something gross,

267
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,527
which becomes crystallized.

268
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,032
The only problem is, I think that we have
to trigger the weblum's defense mechanism.

269
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,700
[rumbling]

270
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,919
[groans]
Not again.

271
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,885
-[rumbling]
-[both] Uh...

272
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,515
[grunts]

273
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
[gasps, screams]

274
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:37,491
They're everywhere!

275
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,122
Oh, whoa.

276
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,832
[both yelling, grunting]

277
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,127
I think this thing is getting rid
of the excess gas produced

278
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,379
from its multiple stomachs.

279
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:54,007
-What?
-It's farting! [laughs]

280
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,386
[grunts]

281
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,389
Hunk, what do we gotta do
to get that scaultrite gland to goop?

282
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,891
Uh, oh. Uh... Wait a second,
wait a second, wait a second.

283
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,935
"Stay away from its face."
The blue laser.

284
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,980
Ah! I know what to do!

285
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,066
What?

286
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,694
If we want that third stomach gland
to secrete the ooze,

287
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,446
I need to get farted out
of the weblum's butt and attack the face,

288
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,699
getting it to fire its laser puke.

289
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,580
For the sake of the universe,
I'll provoke the beast!

290
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,848
You two stay here and get that scaultrite!

291
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,016
Hurry! I don't know how long
we can hold these things off.

292
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,893
[yelling]

293
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,826
I'm out!

294
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,828
Heading to my lion now.

295
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,581
-[door beeping]
-[gasps]

296
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,501
Commander, there you are.

297
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,464
The lower block has
been scanned for luxite.

298
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,226
-I found nothing.
-Then continue the search.

299
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,729
Sir, I must remain by your side.
Haggar's orders.

300
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,152
Hunk, whatever you're
gonna do, do it now!

301
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,075
Roger that.
Provoking giant space worm now.

302
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,077
Come on!

303
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,001
Hunk!

304
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,927
Let's see you ignore me now.

305
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,346
Yoo-hoo! Over here!

306
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,979
Yes! Yes, it's gonna do it!

307
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,565
Oh, no, it's gonna do it!

308
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,914
[gasps]
It's working!

309
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,999
I think it's about to get hot in here.

310
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,960
[Hunk]
Oh, yes!

311
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,169
Oh, no!

312
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,299
[yelling]

313
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,801
[grunts]

314
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,805
Oh, yeah! He's out!

315
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,817
[sighs]
Tell me you got the scaultrite.

316
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,071
[Keith] Grabbing it now.

317
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,163
[weapon whirring]

318
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,540
So, you're just like the rest of 'em.

319
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,591
I'm coming out.

320
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,344
[Hunk]
On my way.

321
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,346
Where's your buddy?

322
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,601
He's long gone by now,
and he got a bag of scaultrite.

323
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,685
What? Should we go after him?

324
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,231
No. Whatever the Galra are planning
won't matter after we defeat Zarkon.

325
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,484
Copy that.

326
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,445
By the way, Hunk, you really came through
in the clutch back there.

327
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,031
Without you, the mission
would have been a failure.

328
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,700
Aw, thanks, Galra Keith.
You're all right.

329
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,701
I think turning Galra has
made you a better human.
