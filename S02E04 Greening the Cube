1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,820
[Shiro] Let's hurry up with these repairs.
Zarkon could be here at any moment.

2
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,239
Okay, panel's off. Now, what?

3
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,493
Very simple. Just loosen
the blaxums on the somoflange.

4
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,246
Could you be more specific?

5
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,333
[Allura] Sorry, Hunk, he means
the poklones on the agroclams.

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,086
-No, that doesn't help.
-Easy, Hunk. I got this.

7
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,508
[whirring, alarm blaring]

8
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,177
Uh-oh. That can't be good.

9
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,389
-No, not the smalters, the poklones!
-No, no! It's the blaxums!

10
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,517
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,568
-There. Fixed.
-[Allura] Well done, Pidge!

12
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,238
The tech on this ship
never ceases to amaze me.

13
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,989
It's so mathematically elegant.

14
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,744
Its fit is a 100 times more frictionless
than any exoskeleton we have on Earth.

15
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:05,041
-It's... beautiful.
-It's not a sunset, Pidge.

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,669
You're right. A billion sunsets
just happen every day.

17
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,589
Some genius engineer actually built this.

18
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,633
Kinda looks like a big,
delicious curly fry.

19
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,844
[groans]
What the...?

20
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,518
All right, we're prepared for this.

21
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,230
Remember your rogue projectile
cluster training from the Garrison.

22
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,149
First, we need a temporary shelter.

23
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,275
[grunts]
Wha--?

24
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,777
 

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,028
Oh, sorry, Shiro.
I was trying to hit Keith.

26
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,989
[growls]

27
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,534


28
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,536
[chuckles]
Like that?

29
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,621
Yes! Squishy asteroid fight!

30
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,957
[all grunting, yelling]

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,834
[Shiro]
All right, guys.

32
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,296
Oh, oh! Okay, now, it's on!

33
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,631
-[laughing]
-Hmm...

34
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,799
-[Lance] Oh, come on!
-I don't think these are asteroids.

35
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,386
Coran, I'm going to need
a containment unit.

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,431
[Coran]
Just a tick.

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,517
They appear to be some
sort of hyper-resilient spore.

38
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,896
[Pidge] This bioluminescent pulsing
doesn't seem natural.

39
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,149
It appears programmed.
I think it's a code.

40
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,443
-A code? From who? [grunts]
-I don't know.

41
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,031
I mean, it makes no sense.
You can't program a spore.

42
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,075
If anyone can figure it out,
it's you, Pidge.

43
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,869
[Allura] Before that, everyone needs
to come in for decontamination.

44
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,206
c

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,590
-[Hunk] Ah...
-[Pidge yelping]

46
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,177
-[Hunk laughing]
-[Lance growling]

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,595
[screaming]

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,680
-[footsteps approaching]
-[door beeping]

49
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,558
Keith, did you happen to see
a mouse come through here?

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,810
He has something of mine.

51
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,022
Uh... no.

52
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,608
-I'll find you, Platt.
-Wait, Coran!

53
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,278
Do you think the Galra ever went to Earth?

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,990
Is that possible?
They would have taken it over, right?

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,245
Oh, I think you'd know
if the Galra were there.

56
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,330
The Blue Lion was there.
Did a Galra pilot the Blue Lion, too?

57
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,999
Hey, why are you asking about my lion?
How many lions do you need?

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,501
-What? No, I-I was just--
-Don't "What? No, I-I was just--" me!

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,255
You've had your eye
on the Blue Lion from day one!

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,091
Well, yeah.
It's the first one we found--

61
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,011
Ah! Bah-bah-bah-bah!

62
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,680
The Blue Lion's with me
and we're very happy together! Very happy!

63
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,350
[Pidge]
Guys! Check this out!

64
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,437
[electronic beeping]

65
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,983
Oh, oh! I've seen this experiment.

66
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,360
But, question: Why do we need
to get electricity from a potato?

67
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,862
What? No, no. I was able to crack
the "sporse code." [chuckles]

68
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,491
I ran the bioluminescent pattern through
a variety of code-breaking sequences,

69
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,536
including this homemade
virtual Turing machine.

70
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,997
Of course, I had to make a few tweaks
to the original design,

71
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,290
because, obviously, there have been
several advancements since he designed it.

72
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:56,546
Although, you have to admit, Turing was
a shining light in the world of science

73
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,007
-in an age when far too many were still--
-Pidge.

74
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,968
-[yelps]
-What does it say?

75
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,056
Oh, yeah. "Under attack. Galra. Help."
And then, there are coordinates.

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,142
It's a distress signal. Good work, Pidge.

77
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:13,313
Get those coordinates
into the castle-ship's navigation system.

78
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,025
[Coran] The signal came from Olkarion,
home to the Olkari,

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,276
a proud class of engineers,

80
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,945
builders of vast cities that could change
shape at the whim of their creators.

81
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,532
[Allura] They had a seemingly
magical ability to manipulate solid metal.

82
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,745
With just a wave of their hands,

83
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,706
they could build a computer
inside a block of steel.

84
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,125
-Whoa.
-An Olkari once gave me this!

85
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,043
-What is it?
-Uh, hello? It's a floating cube!

86
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,296
[laughs]
Oh, this guy. And watch!

87
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,299
My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.

88
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,634
[beeping]

89
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,512
[Coran's voice]
My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.

90
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,682
Why would a society
full of literal tech wizards

91
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,101
use spores to send a distress signal?

92
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,021
Who cares?
When do we get to see that city?

93
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,031
Actually, Pidge, the distress signal
isn't coming from the city.

94
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,035
It's coming from... the forest.

95
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,205
[gasps]
Oh...

96
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,585
Why doesn't anyone ever send
a distress signal from a cool place?

97
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,380
[Pidge] I hate the outdoors.
Nothing but sunburn and poison oak.

98
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,050
I like it out here. It's quiet.
[gasps]

99
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,395
-What was that?
-Uh, are we being attacked?

100
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,024
I don't know, but something's dragging
my lion down to the surface.

101
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,778
[Lance]
Yeah, something's pulling Blue down, too.

102
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,697
Are those wooden mech suits?

103
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,202
Are you kidding me? We got taken down
by a bunch of tree people!

104
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,875
[Shiro over speaker]
We come in peace!

105
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,420
Could it be? Voltron?

106
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,424
We found your distress signal!

107
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,219
-Praise Lubos!
-[Olkari] Lubos!

108
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,764
[cheering, chanting]
Lubos!

109
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,518
When the Galra attacked,
only a few of us escaped the cities.

110
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,728
We were forced to flee into the forest.

111
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,190
-How long have you lived like this?
-Many decafeebs.

112
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,991
But, as you can see,
our people are resilient.

113
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,126
We never stopped evolving.

114
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,837
Instead, we adapted our skills
to the environment.

115
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,840
[panting]

116
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,009
Coran was right, Ryner.

117
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:52,096
You really are the most incredible
engineers in the universe.

118
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,600
To be able to switch from working
with precision machinery

119
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,268
to a bunch of sticks!

120
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,229
Nature's designs are superior
to any that we could devise.

121
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:05,610
No offense, but I'll take
my computer over a tree any day.

122
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,861
You two can talk science later.

123
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,655
Let's assemble Voltron
and get rid of these Galra invaders.

124
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,491
It's not that simple, I'm afraid.
The Galra have our leader, Lubos.

125
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,172
[Olkari]
Lubos...

126
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,509
If you attack, who knows
what they'll do to him?

127
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,930
Then, we'll just have to rescue him.

128
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,893
-[over speaker] Work faster! Faster!
-[Olkari grunting]

129
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:48,402
For a bunch of slaves
with magical, metalworking powers,

130
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,905
they're taking an awfully long time
to build my super weapon.

131
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,287
Perhaps they need a little bit
of motivation. Show them their king!

132
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,627
No... No more! Please don't hurt me!

133
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,170
-[gasping]
-[sobbing]

134
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,803
That's more like it.

135
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,815
Um... Ryner, where are we?

136
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,735
This is the armory.

137
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,737
Whoa...

138
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,074
-[all scream, gasp]
-[Hunk] Huh?

139
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,286
�

140
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,497
-Cool!
-Uh, can I get one of those?

141
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:46,168
[Ryner]
Of course. You can each have one.

142
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,087
Now, the key to operating it
is understanding

143
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,591
that the nanocellulose responds
to electrical impulses

144
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,927
from the neural pathways
connected through this.

145
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,114
-Do what now?
-Mm. Mm! Makes my tongue itchy.

146
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,366
That's your interface?

147
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,079
Of course, all commands need to come
as binary coded messages.

148
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,958
So, like this.

149
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,919
-Yes! Excellent!
-I think mine is just a tree.

150
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:33,424
You must have
a deep connection with nature.

151
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,968
Not really. My allergies and pale skin
don't mix with outdoor living.

152
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,179
-Pidge is our resident tech expert.
-Well, that explains it.

153
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:42,058
Like the Olkari, you understand
that, at the deepest level,

154
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:48,397
trees, metal, you, me...
we're all made up of the same cosmic dust,

155
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,075
all arranged by the laws of mathematics.

156
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,746
Does this mean I should start gardening?

157
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,041
It means you're going to need
to give your friends a ride.

158
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,670
This way! To the edge of the forest!
To save our king!

159
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,844
Finally, the cube is ready for launch.

160
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,181
Load the top Olkari engineers
onto our ships and prepare for departure.

161
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,558
After the cube destroys Olkarion,

162
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,851
hopefully, Zarkon will welcome us
back to the main fleet.

163
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,562
[Ryner] Their headquarters
are impenetrable from the ground,

164
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,149
but there is one way in,
a small opening in the roof.

165
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,484
It goes all the way down
to an open courtyard.

166
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,030
That's quite a drop.

167
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,324
But there you will have
total access to the building.

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,910
The hard part will be
getting onto the roof undetected.

169
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,788
[Shiro]
That won't be a problem.

170
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,915
Hey, hey, what's that?
Is that part of the building?

171
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:52,920
My Lubos! It can't be!

172
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,213
Hey! That looks like the cube
Coran gave me!

173
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,549
I haven't seen one of those
in many decafeebs.

174
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,717
We used to play with them as children.

175
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,304
But this... Only King Lubos
could have designed one that size.

176
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,642
Why would he do that?

177
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,563
They must have forced him
to reveal his designs

178
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,316
and reconstruct it as a weapon.

179
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,444
From the looks of it,
I'd say it's almost finished.

180
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,280
Okay, we need to act fast.
Everyone, back to base. I have a plan.

181
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,990
First, we'll need to get
to the top of that tower.

182
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,841
Since the Green Lion
has stealth capabilities,

183
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,428
Pidge, you're the drop ship.

184
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,985
You'll take Keith, Hunk,
Lance, and me to the roof,

185
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,403
then drop back to a safe position.

186
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:06,410
After the drop, we'll use a sensor to scan
the building for any Olkari biorhythms.

187
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,163
[rapid beeping]

188
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,875
[moaning, sobbing inside]

189
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,836
[sobbing continues]

190
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,840
[sobbing continues]

191
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,802
[Lubos]
Betrayal!

192
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,139
[sobbing]

193
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,141
She loves you!
[sobbing]

194
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,894
�

195
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,066
King Lubos?

196
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,403
Yes? Who are you?
The jesters I requested?

197
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,157
Um, we're here to, like, rescue you?

198
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,535
Hmm...

199
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,247
[alarm blaring]

200
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,666
You could have just said, "No, thanks."

201
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,752
Looks like someone came
to rescue you, Lubos.

202
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,256
You turned your back on your people
to save your own skin?

203
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,258
I'm doing this for my people!

204
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,842
They wanted to fight the Galra,
but they are too powerful!

205
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,429
The Galra could destroy us!

206
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,057
So, you helped enslave your people
to build some super weapon?

207
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,853
Don't make me the bad guy!
He forced me to do it!

208
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,523
Did he force-feed you, too?

209
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,067
Uh...

210
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,113
You're no king.

211
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,824
[whimpers, groans]

212
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,412
Okay, we're walking out of here!
Anyone tries to stop us and Lubos gets it!

213
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,082
-Whoa, K-Keith!
-That came out of nowhere!

214
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,377
La-sai, what are you doing?

215
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,837
You betrayed our people.
I can't live this lie anymore.

216
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,506
You don't want me to hurt
your genius engineer, right?

217
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,966
Oh, be my guest. His work is done.
The cube is complete.

218
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,553
What? But-But I thought we had a deal!

219
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,888
Guards, put them all out of their misery.

220
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,642
[all scream]

221
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,813
[grunting, coughing]

222
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,316
[Pidge]
Your ride is here!

223
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,317
Engage the cube! Take down the lion!

224
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,238
[all panting]

225
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,075
[both grunt]

226
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,660
[Shiro]
The cube is operational!

227
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,412
We've got to get back
to the other lions and form Voltron!

228
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,998
[Pidge]
On it!

229
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,500
-[groans]
-[Olkari gasp]

230
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,170

231
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,505
[Olkari murmuring]
Lubos...

232
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,844
#

233
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,473
What's going on?

234
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,977
While your countrymen starved,

235
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,941
King Lubos was well
taken care of by the Galra.

236
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,568
He willingly helped them
build that cube,

237
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,487
willingly helped
to enslave his own people.

238
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,047
-[all gasp]
-Lubos...

239
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,394
O

240
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,234
I know you're devastated, but it's time
to be strong and use your Olkari spirit

241
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,030
\

242
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,287
to fight alongside Voltron
and take back your planet!

243
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,082
Lubos, how could you?

244
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,084
-I... I was only trying to--
-Enough! We must free our people!

245
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,760
[Olkari cheering]

246
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,359
[roars]

247
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,320
[roars]

248
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,866
[Shiro] All right, team,
let's take that thing down!

249
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,452
Form shield!

250
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,288
Let's see how tough this magic cube is.

251
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,881
Did it just absorb our lasers?

252
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,592
We need to increase firepower!
Hunk, use your blaster!

253
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,720
-I'm not sure this is a good idea.
-Got it!

254
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,014
Yeah, I think it's working!

255
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,099
It's giving back whatever we fire into it,
like Coran's echo cube.

256
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,652
That's what I was trying
to tell you guys! It's learning!

257
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,073
Making its own versions
of our weapons to use against us!

258
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,078
[Lance] We can't just sit here.
We've got to move!

259
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,749
[all scream]

260
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,337
[Hunk]
How do we beat it?

261
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,013
Maybe, if we form our sword,
we can cut through the surface

262
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,267
and hack right into the center
thinking point place?

263
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:28,107
Can't be any worse
than what's happening now.

264
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,526
Let's do it. Form sword!

265
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,200
[Pidge]
It's working!

266
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,412
It's still operational! Re-engage!

267
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,791
[Hunk]
We did it! They're going down!

268
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,835
[Lance]
Uh-oh!

269
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,379
[Shiro]
We've got to move! Move!

270
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,924
[grunts] We can't fight them like this!
We need to split up! Back into lions!

271
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,719
Excellent. Voltron doesn't stand
a chance against my weapon.

272
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,140
Soon, I'll have both the cube and Voltron
to present to Emperor Zarkon.

273
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,311
Let's see if I can freeze these guys!

274
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh, no! So cold, so cold!

275
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,861
-Oh, oh. Thanks, Keith.
-You got it.

276
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,530
Shiro, what are we going to do?

277
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,324
There doesn't seem
to be any way to stop them,

278
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,703
but we can't let this weapon
get into Zarkon's hands!

279
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,415
-[screams]
-Pidge!

280
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,294
The Green Lion's in trouble!

281
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:36,091
[Hunk]
Pidge! Are you okay?

282
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,178
[groaning]

283
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,514
-[Ryner] Pidge, can you hear me?
-Yeah. Wait.

284
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,934
-How am I hearing you?
-That's not important right now.

285
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,686
We need to get your lion
back up and running.

286
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,379
I think we can heal your lion's body,

287
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,508
but you must bond with its spirit
if it is to fly again.

288
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,137
-But I thought we bonded already.
-Your bond must be stronger.

289
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,056
Come on, girl. I need you.

290
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,183
Remember what I said.
You, the lion, the Olkari...

291
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,318
We are all made of the same essence.

292
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,821
[Shiro]
Where are you, Pidge? We need you!

293
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,343
-[all groaning, grunting]
-[Keith] Pidge!

294
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,888
-[groaning continues]
-Pidge!

295
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,807
-Guys, hang on!
-[all] Pidge!

296
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,311
[Hunk] Whoa, Pidge!
What's going on? You're booking!

297
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,564
I'm not sure, but I feel more connected
with my lion than ever!

298
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,317
I know what I have to do!

299
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,111
[roars]

300
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,950
Whoa! How'd you do that?

301
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,911
That's right! Circle up, everybody!
Get some of this!

302
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,956
[chuckles]
Vines...

303
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, that is not the way I thought
a giant cube of death would go down.

304
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,002
No!

305
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,631
Commander, we have to evacuate.

306
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,385
The cube is down,
and the Olkari have taken back the city.

307
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,973

[all cheering]

310
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,570
I want to thank you all.
You helped us get our home back.

311
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,991
And, for that, we will never
be able to repay you.

312
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,745
Just promise me that when it's time
to take the fight to Zarkon,

313
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,540
we can count on the Olkari for help.

314
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,916
Now and forever.

315
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,129
And you...
The spirit of the Olkari resides in you.

316
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,883
The bond between you and your lion
has grown stronger than ever.

317
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:27,054
Without you, I would never have been
able to unlock my lion's hidden power.

318
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,683
-[Shiro] Nice job, Pidge.
-You know, it's weird.

319
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,270
I've always been a tech junkie.
That's how I connected with the world.

320
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,272
But, for the first time,
I feel connected to everything.

321
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,940
I guess it's like Ryner said.
We're all made up of the same cosmic dust.

322
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,109
So, that means we're all related.

323
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,111
This ship, those stars, the Olkari.

324
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,285
Even the Galra.

325
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,286
Uh-oh. I think Keith
just blew his own mind.
